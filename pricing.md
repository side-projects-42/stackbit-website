Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

### How many free websites can I create?<span class="faq-item-icon icon-plus" aria-hidden="true"></span>

<span class="faq-item-sep" aria-hidden="true"></span>

As many as you’d like :) Go ahead and explore all the themes, Jamstack tools and stack combinations. As far as paid tiers, Pro and Business plans are priced per website, and Enterprise plans include multiple sites.

### Do I need to provide a credit card for a free trial?<span class="faq-item-icon icon-plus" aria-hidden="true"></span>

<span class="faq-item-sep" aria-hidden="true"></span>

Nope, not at all. You’re welcome to try out our Pro and Business plans for 7 days without entering a credit card.

### What payment methods do you accept?<span class="faq-item-icon icon-plus" aria-hidden="true"></span>

<span class="faq-item-sep" aria-hidden="true"></span>

We accept credit cards and charge them on a monthly basis. If you need other payment or billing arrangements, feel free to reach out to us at <pricing@stackbit.com>.

### What kind of support should I expect?<span class="faq-item-icon icon-plus" aria-hidden="true"></span>

<span class="faq-item-sep" aria-hidden="true"></span>

We are a small team of Jamstack enthusiasts who truly care about your success with Stackbit. We read every single piece of feedback and support request and follow up internally with our product and engineering teams. You can and should always expect stellar service from us, no matter which plan you choose. On the Free plan, we communicate via email. On paid plans, we commit to specific SLAs, and have more options in terms of communication channels and dedicated contacts within Stackbit. Either way — we’re here to help.

### What if my site was created before pricing was introduced?<span class="faq-item-icon icon-plus" aria-hidden="true"></span>

<span class="faq-item-sep" aria-hidden="true"></span>

Pricing is only relevant for new websites. Your previously-created sites will be classified as Legacy and will remain free with all of their current features.

### What will happen to my site if I cancel my paid plan?<span class="faq-item-icon icon-plus" aria-hidden="true"></span>

<span class="faq-item-sep" aria-hidden="true"></span>

If you choose to cancel your paid plan, your website will automatically switch to the Free plan and you’ll be able to continue working on it in the Studio. Your collaborators will lose access to the site, and you will not be able to use any advanced features.
