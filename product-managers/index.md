Are you or your marketers blocked by engineering dependencies?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Working on a modern tech stack usually means non-technical content editors are either dependent on developers support or forced to work with cumbersome interfaces. With Stackbit everyone can edit and work on the site completely independently.

CTO and Engineer Approved.
--------------------------

Keep engineers focused on the core business while knowing editors have guardrails to prevent the site from breaking. If they ever need to step in, this is the tech stack and tools they would have chosen to use in the first place.

"Stackbit saved us at a very crucial time. We have very limited resources and engineering time on our core product is so valuable."

"Since then, our team is publishing content again, and it's taking minutes instead of many hours. We can focus on the message and not on replicating design. It is exactly how content publishing should be."

"From a tech perspective, we're also much more comfortable understanding we have full control over the content and are not vendor locked."
