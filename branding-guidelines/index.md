Logo Assets & Guidance

## Stackbit Logo

We are proud of our logo, and we require that you follow these guidelines to ensure it always acts and behaves the same. Our logo is the combination of a modern monogram and simple wordmark. While the monogram can exist without the wordmark, the wordmark should never exist without the monogram.
