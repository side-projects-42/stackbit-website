Tutorial: Adding Stackbit to a Hugo Theme (part 2/2)
====================================================

Robert Austin — August 26, 2019

This is part 2 of our tutorial on adding Stackbit to an existing Hugo theme. In this tutorial we will model our Hugo themes data and configuration files. We also cover some more advanced model types including Object models and object field models.

Tutorial: Adding Stackbit to a Hugo Theme (part 2/2)
----------------------------------------------------

This is the second part of a 2 part tutorial on adding Stackbit to an existing Hugo theme. [Read Tutorial Part 1](https://www.stackbit.com/blog/hugo-stackbit-tutorial)

Adding Config & Data Files
--------------------------

In [Part 1](https://www.stackbit.com/blog/hugo-stackbit-tutorial) we modelled all the markdown files in our theme, but what about data and config files?

Data models can be used to model any .JSON, .YAML and .TOML files located under the `dataDir`. Depending on your theme and ssg the data might be content for your theme, data for components and also the theme configuration file.

### features.json

The tutorial theme <https://github.com/stackbithq/uniform-hugo-tutorial> has a list of "highlights" on the homepage. They are the boxes that appear at the bottom ie "Free Consultation" etc.

These highlights use a Hugo data file located in `data/features.json`. The data file looks like this.

    // data/features.json

    {
        "highlights": [
            {
                "title": "Free Consultation",
                "description": "New clients recieve an obligation free consultation.",
                "image": "images/features/noun_branding_1885335.svg"
            },
            {
                "title": "Certified Accountants",
                "description": "All members of our team are certified accountants.",
                "image": "images/features/noun_The Process_1885341.svg"
            },
            {
                "title": "Tax Compliance",
                "description": "We stay up to date on the latest changes to the tax code.",
                "image": "images/features/noun_3d modeling_1885342.svg"
            }
        ]
    }

features.json contains a highlights object, which contains an array of objects. We are going to use a [list field type](https://docs.stackbit.com/uniform/field-models/#list_field_type) with a nested [object field type](https://docs.stackbit.com/uniform/field-models/#object_field) to model this data.

    features:
        type: data
        label: Features
        file: features.json
        fields:
            - type: list
              name: highlights
              items:
                  type: object
                  label: Highlight
                  labelField: title
                  fields:
                      - type: string
                        name: title
                        label: Title
                      - type: string
                        name: description
                        label: Description
                      - type: image
                        name: image
                        label: Icon

Data models follow a very similiar format to page models but importantly they use `type: data` instead of `type: page`.

Earlier in the tutorial we set the `dataDir` to `dataDir: exampleSite` (at the top of our stackbit.yaml). When we match a data model to the file it's going to be relative to this directory. So in this case we use the matching open `file: features.json` to match the data file.

### contact.yaml

.yaml files are also valid data sources. Here is the data model for `data/contact.yaml`

      contact:
        type: data
        label: Contact Info
        file: contact.yaml
        fields:
          - type: string
            name: email
            label: Email
          - type: string
            name: phone
            label: Phone

Configuration Files
-------------------

Most ssgs have a configuration file. Stackbit treats config files as normal data models. Here is the data model for the themes config file located at `exampleSite/config.yaml`.

**This code example does not yet include the menus.**

    config:
        type: data
        label: Config
        file: config.toml
        fields:
            - type: string
              name: title
              label: Title
              required: true
            - type: string
              name: baseURL
              label: Base URL
              description: Hostname (and path) to the root
              hidden: true
            - type: string
              name: languageCode
              label: Language Code
              hidden: true
            - type: string
              name: themesDir
              label: Themes Directory
              hidden: true
            - type: string
              name: theme
              label: Theme Name
              hidden: true
            - type: object
              name: params
              label: Params
              description: Site parameters
              required: true
              fields:
                  - type: string
                    name: google_analytics_id
                    label: Google Analytics ID
                  - type: string
                    name: google_tag_manager_id
                    label: Google Tag Manager ID
                  - type: object

                        - type: string
                          name: alt
                          label: Logo Alt Text
                  - type: object
                    name: homepage_meta_tags
                    label: Homepage Metatags
                    fields:
                        - type: string
                          name: meta_description
                          label: meta_description
                        - type: string
                          name: meta_og_title
                          label: meta_og_title
                        - type: string
                          name: meta_og_type
                          label: meta_og_type
                        - type: string
                          name: meta_og_url
                          label: meta_og_url
                        - type: string
                          name: meta_og_image
                          label: meta_og_image

                          label: meta_og_description
                        - type: string
                          name: meta_twitter_card
                          label: meta_twitter_card
                        - type: string
                          name: meta_twitter_site
                          label: meta_twitter_site
                        - type: string
                          name: meta_twitter_creator
                          label: meta_twitter_creator

### Modelling Hugo Menus

This theme has 2 menus. `main` and `footer` which can be viewed in the `config.yaml`

    # exampleSite/config.yaml

    ...

    [menu]
      # Main Menu
      [[menu.main]]
        name = "Services"
        url = "/services/"
          weight = 1

      [[menu.main]]
          name = "Team"
          url = "/team/"
          weight = 2

      # Footer Menu
      [[menu.footer]]
        name = "Home"
        url = "/"
          weight = 1

      [[menu.footer]]
        name = "Contact"
        url = "/contact/"
          weight = 2

Here we are going to use a [Object Model](https://docs.stackbit.com/uniform/object-models/). Ie a content model of `type: object` and we are going to reference it using an [Object Model Field](https://docs.stackbit.com/uniform/field-models/#object_model_field).

    # stackbit.yaml
    ...
    models:
      ...
      site_menus:
        type: object # object model
        label: Site Menus
        fields:
          - type: list
            name: main
            label: Main menu
            description: List of items for Main menu
            items:
              type: site_menu_item
          - type: list
            name: footer
            label: Footer menu
            description: List of items for Footer menu
            items:
              type: site_menu_item
      site_menu_item:
        type: object
        label: Site Menu Item
        labelField: name
        fields:
          - type: string
            name: identifier
            label: Identifier
          - type: string
            name: name
            label: Title
            description: The title of the menu item
            required: true
          - type: string
            name: url
            label: URL
            description: The URL the menu item links to
            required: true
          - type: number
            name: weight
            label: Weight
            description: Position for sorting
          - type: string
            name: parent
            label: Parent Menu Identifier
            description: The parent of an entry should be the identifier of another entry.

We've created 2 object models. "site*menus" is a list of menu objects. It includes Main Menu and Footer Menu, which include an object model reference to "site*menu\_items".

"site*menu*items" is a single object, with the 4 fields that are used in a Hugo menu item.

Now in the CMS you can add new top level Menus ie Sidebar Menu, and you can add, edit and delete individual menu items from existing menus.

Finally we need to add a reference to "site\_menus" to the data model for `config.yaml`

    # stackbit.yaml
    ...
    models:
      ...
      config:
        ...
        - type: site_menus # references the object model we created in the previous step
          name: menu
          label: Menus

Wrapping Up
-----------

Now we've modelled both the themes pages and data. The Uniform theme conversion is complete.
