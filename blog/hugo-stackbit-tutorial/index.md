Tutorial: Adding Stackbit to a Hugo theme (part 1/2)
====================================================

Robert Austin â€” August 14, 2019

In this tutorial I'm going to walk you through converting an open source Hugo theme into a Stackbit Uniform theme. You can do this with any Hugo site and once it's done you can import the theme into Stackbit, connect it to a headless CMS and deploy to Netlify in just 1 click.

**Adding Stackbit to a Hugo theme**
-----------------------------------

Stackbit recently announced [Custom Themes](https://www.stackbit.com/blog/announcing-custom-themes-and-so-much-more/). Stackbit already has lots of pre-built themes to choose from but what if you want to use your own theme? Or use a theme built on a static site generator that isn't currently supported by Stackbit? That's where custom themes comes in.

Before you start you can try importing the final version of the theme we are going to recreate. Click this link: <https://app.stackbit.com/create?theme=https://github.com/JugglerX/hugo-serif-theme> - Magic!

Quick Overview
--------------

In this tutorial I'm going to use this Github repo as a reference. <https://github.com/stackbithq/uniform-hugo-tutorial>

We are going to use this theme as a base. This is a regular Hugo theme without Stackbit added. We are going to convert it to a Uniform theme using the following process.

1.  Add a `stackbit.yaml` file with a basic configuration
2.  Define [page models](https://docs.stackbit.com/uniform/page-models/) and [field models](https://docs.stackbit.com/uniform/content-models/) for our markdown files and define [data models](https://docs.stackbit.com/uniform/data-models/) for the config.toml and JSON data files in the `data` folder.
3.  Use the Stackbit CLI validator tool to help test and debug.
4.  Import the converted theme it into Stackbit and connect a CMS.

### Download the repo

Fork the repo at `https://github.com/stackbithq/uniform-hugo-tutorial` to your own Github. Clone it down to your local.

### Do a dummy import into Stackbit.

Using your forked repo, let's try and import the theme into Stackbit without any modifications.

1.  Signup or Login to Stackbit.com
2.  Visit the custom theme importer - <https://app.stackbit.com/create>
3.  Paste your Github repo

At this point you will see the validator fails.

Lets go ahead and add the stackbit.yaml

Create a stackbit.yaml file
---------------------------

Create a new file called `stackbit.yaml` in the projects root (same level as the README.md) and add the following fields.

    stackbitVersion: ~0.2.0
    ssgName: custom

Since we are importing our own custom theme, we need to set the `ssgName` field to `custom` - If you don't set this the convertor will attempt to use default values which are not suitable for a Hugo theme.

Commit and push this change to you Github repo. Try and import the theme into Stackbit again. The stackbit.yaml file will now be found, but you will encounter a variety of validator errors. Progress.

### Install the validator

Instead of each time having to import the theme into Stackbit there is a faster way to test our theme. Install the [Unibit CLI](https://docs.stackbit.com/unibit/unibit-cli/)

    npm install -g @stackbit/unibit

Now you can validate the theme locally. Run the following command from the directory containing the stackbit.yaml.

    unibit validate

The CLI validator also provides more robust errors and hints. You can see that we are missing quite a few required fields in the stackbit.yaml.

### Add required fields to the stackbit.yaml

Read the [stackbit.yaml documentation](https://docs.stackbit.com/uniform/stackbit-yaml) for information on the available fields.

Go ahead and add the following fields to the stackbit.yaml

    stackbitVersion: ~0.2.0
    ssgName: custom
    publishDir: exampleSite/public
    buildCommand: cd exampleSite && hugo --gc --baseURL "/" --themesDir ../.. && cd ..
    uploadDir: images
    staticDir: exampleSite/static
    pagesDir: exampleSite/content
    dataDir: exampleSite

pagesDir is required. It tells Stackbit where to look for markdown files. Typically the markdown files are turned into your sites pages, blog posts etc. In this theme the .md files are located inside of `exampleSite/content` so let's set `pagesDir: exampleSite/content`.

**Note:** If you install a Hugo theme as a "sub theme" then you probably wouldn't have the exampleSite folder here. Modify your paths to these folders accordingly.

Re-run the validator.

    unibit validate

All the basic required fields should be validating, and it's now attempting to load the first pages and match them with content models. So you should be seeing an error at the "Validating Pages" step now.

Adding Content Models
---------------------

For a CMS to edit your site it needs to understand the content in a structured format that can be mapped to a database and or GUI interface.

In the stackbit.yaml we are going to write our first [content models](https://docs.stackbit.com/uniform/content-models/). Content models can be either [page models](https://docs.stackbit.com/uniform/page-models/) or [data models](https://docs.stackbit.com/uniform/data-models/). Typically page models are markdown files with front-matter and data models are JSON/YAML/TOML files. Both page models and data models may have nested [field models](https://docs.stackbit.com/uniform/field-models/)

Add a `models` field to the stackbit.yaml. All page and data models are nested under this field.

    stackbitVersion: ~0.2.0
    ssgName: custom
    publishDir: exampleSite/public
    buildCommand: cd exampleSite && hugo --gc --baseURL "/" --themesDir ../.. && cd ..
    uploadDir: images
    staticDir: exampleSite/static
    pagesDir: exampleSite/content
    dataDir: exampleSite
    models:
        ...

### Page Models

Take a look at the themes content folder located in `exampleSite/content` It contains several markdown files, some are in folders. Some of these markdown files use particular layouts and have different front-matter.

We need to provide page models for all of the files. A page model is not required for each individual file, but to create logical groupings that represent "content types"

### 404 page model

Let's add the first page model for the 404 page.

Inside of `models` field create a new [page model](https://docs.stackbit.com/uniform/page-models/) with the name "pagenotfound".

    models:
        pagenotfound:
            type: page
            label: '404'
            file: 404/_index.md
            hideContent: true
            singleInstance: true
            fields:
              - type: string
                name: title
                label: Title
                description: The title of the page.

We defined a page model called "pagenotfound". You can use whatever name you like for the top level key. The content model type is specified by `type: page`. The label is used to help identify the page type in the CMS. In the case of the 404 page, there is only 1 page of this type in the theme, so we used `file: 404/_index.md` to point to a single file. Since it is a single file we set `singleInstance: true`, this let's the CMS know we can't create more of these pages and it also prevents the validator from trying to re-match this file if other page models use glob matching.

Inside of the page model are the [field models](https://docs.stackbit.com/uniform/field-models/) which are defined under the `fields` key. You must define a field model for each front-matter field in the markdown file. In this case we define one field model for the "title" which is of the type string. This will create a text input field in the CMS.

Run the validator and the 404 page should pass.

### Homepage page model

        home:
            type: page
            label: Home
            file: _index.md
            hideContent: false
            singleInstance: true
            fields:
              - type: string
                name: title
                label: Title
                description: The title of the page.
                required: true
              - type: image
                name: intro_image
                label: Intro Image
                description: Image displayed at in the pages intro section
              - type: boolean
                name: intro_image_absolute
                label: Overflow intro image
                description: Should the image overflow or be contained
              - type: boolean
                name: intro_image_hide_on_mobile
                label: Hide the intro image on mobile
                description: Hide the intro image on mobile screen sizes

The homepage is similar to the 404. It's a singleInstance page model which has a few extra fields.

There are few new field model types. `image` and `boolean`. image type creates a file upload widget in the CMS and boolean creates a checkbox or toggle widget.

### Basic pages model

Next we will model the About Us `exampleSite/content/about.md` and Contact Us `exampleSite/content/contact.md` pages.

Things get a little more interested here. We want to be able to create new basic pages in the CMS, for example a good ol "privacy policy" page. So instead of modelling a specific file, we are creating an abstraction of a reusable "basic page"

    basicpage:
        type: page
        label: Basic Page
        match: '*.md'
        exclude: _index.md
        fields:
          - type: string
            name: title
            label: Title
            description: The title of the page.
          - type: date
            name: date
            label: Date
          - type: string
            name: layout
            label: layout
          - type: string
            name: menu
            label: Menu

The main difference with this page model is the `match` and `exclude` fields. Instead of using `file`, we use match and exclude which allow us to glob match any files that meet particular requirements. In this case we want to target any file in the top level content folder except for the `_index.md` (which is the homepage and has a different page model)

There is a new field type of `date` which creates a date picker widget in the CMS.

### Services page model (services list)

    services:
        type: page
        label: Services Overview
        file: services/_index.md
        singleInstance: true
        fields:
          - type: string
            name: title
            label: Title
            description: The title of the page.
            required: true
          - type: image
            name: intro_image
            label: Intro Image
            description: Image displayed at in the pages intro section
          - type: boolean
            name: intro_image_absolute
            label: Intro Image Position
            description: Should the image overflow or be contained
          - type: boolean
            name: intro_image_hide_on_mobile
            label: Intro Image Hide On Mobile
            description: Hide the intro image on mobile screen sizes

### Service page model (single service pages)

    service:
        type: page
        label: Service
        folder: services
        fields:
          - type: string
            name: title
            label: Title
          - type: date
            name: date
            label: Date
          - type: image
            name: image
            label: Image
          - type: boolean
            name: draft
            label: Draft
          - type: boolean
            name: featured
            label: Featured

The service pages live in `services` folder along with the `_index.md` used by the services page model. In the basicpage page model we used `exclude: _index.md` too explicitly exclude the \_index.md. That's an option here as well but because we set `singleInstance: true` on the services page model that file is automatically removed from the possible matches. So in this case we don't have to exclude \_index.md. Both approaches are OK.

### Teams page model (team list)

      teams:
        type: page
        label: Team Overview
        file: team/_index.md
        singleInstance: true
        fields:
          - type: string
            name: title
            label: Title
            description: The title of the page.
            required: true
          - type: image
            name: intro_image
            label: Intro Image
            description: Image displayed at in the pages intro section
          - type: boolean
            name: intro_image_absolute
            label: Intro Image Position
            description: Should the image overflow or be contained
          - type: boolean
            name: intro_image_hide_on_mobile
            label: Intro Image Hide On Mobile
            description: Hide the intro image on mobile screen sizes

### Team page model (team single)

    team:
        type: page
        label: Team
        folder: team
        exclude: _index.md
        fields:
          - type: string
            name: title
            label: Title
          - type: date
            name: date
            label: Date
          - type: image
            name: image
            label: Image
          - type: string
            name: jobtitle
            label: Job Title
          - type: string
            name: linkedinurl
            label: Linkedin URL
          - type: boolean
            name: draft
            label: Draft
          - type: boolean
            name: featured
            label: Featured
          - type: number
            name: weight
            label: Weight

Validating Page Models
----------------------

Now we have defined page models for all of our content let's run the validator again and just check in.

    unibit validate

The validator takes all of the files it finds inside of the `pagesDir` and attempts to find a matching page model inside the `models` field. If the validator finds a file with no matching page model defined in the stackbit.yaml it will throw an error.

If all files have an associated page model it will proceed to validate the field models inside each.

At this stage you should be seeing a few field level validation errors.

    Validating Pages
    âœ” matching pages to models
    âœ” pagenotfound â‡” 404/_index.md

    âœ” teams â‡” team/_index.md
    âœ” team â‡” team/peter-van-eijk.md
    âœ” team â‡” team/sage-kirk.md

    âš  2 errors found

It looks like we've missed a field definition for the front-matter field "weight" in the service page model.

Update the service page model and add the weight field.

      service:
        type: page
        label: Service
        folder: services
        fields:
          ...
          - type: number
            name: weight
            label: Weight

Ready To Import
---------------

We've modelled all of the pages in our theme.

Visit <https://app.stackbit.com/create> and import your theme.

There is still more work to do modelling our config and data files but we can leave that for now. You do not have to model data for the theme to import and work with Stackbit. It just means these files will not yet be editable in the CMS.

Choose a CMS and deploy!
------------------------

You can choose to connect to any CMS at this point. For now let's try DatoCMS. Choose DatoCMS and click "connect accounts". You will need a DatoCMS account, but it should prompt you authenticate or signup or in-app. Once you've connected DatoCMS click "create your project"

Stackbit is now going to convert and build the theme for DatoCMS and deploy it to Netlify.

Once the site is built you can login to DatoCMS and explore the CMS. Go ahead, edit some of the fields or the content. These changes will be published to your live Netlify site.

Wrapping Up
-----------

That's the first stage to importing a 3rd party Hugo theme into Stackbit. In the next tutorial I'll cover modelling the data and config files and exploring some more advanced field models including object references to better model our menus.
