# Tutorial: Adding Stackbit to a Jekyll theme

Tomas Bankauskas — September 01, 2019

In this tutorial you will learn how to convert your Jekyll theme to a [Stackbit Uniform theme](https://www.stackbit.com/uniform-themes/). With Stackbit Uniform, you can connect your theme to headless CMS and deploy it to Netlify in minutes.

## Overview

For this tutorial we are going to use the following process:

1.  Overview how Stackbit works
2.  Prepare our development environment
3.  Create the stackbit.yaml file in the Jekyll theme and add required fields
4.  Define content models in stackbit.yaml
5.  Validate our theme with the Stackbit CLI validator
6.  Import the converted theme to Stackbit and connect it to a CMS of your choice.

## Overview How Stackbit Works

To make your Jekyll theme work with Stackbit, you will need to create the stackbit.yaml file in the root folder of your theme. In this file you will define content models which map your theme content to a structured schema.

## Prepare Our Development Environment

To start things off, first create the Stackbit account. Then fork the repo at [uniform-jekyll-tutorial](https://github.com/stackbithq/uniform-jekyll-tutorial) and clone it to your local machine. It will be our starting point. For testing and debugging we will need to install [Unibit CLI](https://docs.stackbit.com/unibit/unibit-cli/) from Stackbit. It will help us to validate the theme.

`npm install -g @stackbit/unibit`

After the installation is complete, we are ready to go.

## Create the stackbit.yaml File in the Jekyll Theme and Add Required Fields

When you have the repo cloned and Unibit CLI set up on your local machine, let's move on and create the **stackbit.yaml** file in the Jekyll theme root directory. After you did that, add the basic fields to the file:

    stackbitVersion: ~0.2.0
    ssgName: jekyll

Try Unibit CLI and validate Jekyll theme with the `unibit validate` command. Since we've added basic configuration to the stackbit.yaml file, Unibit tries to fill out the rest of the fields as it knows we are using Jekyll.

The next step is to add the required fields to the file. As the name suggests these fields should be present in every **stackbit.yaml** file:

    stackbitVersion: "~0.2.0"
    ssgName: jekyll
    staticDir: ""
    uploadDir: images
    buildCommand: "gem install jekyll bundler && bundle install && bundle exec jekyll build"
    publishDir: "_site"
    dataDir: ""
    pagesDir: ""

If you want to learn more about these fields, please head on to the [Stackbit Docs](https://docs.stackbit.com/uniform/stackbit-yaml/).

## Define Content Models in stackbit.yaml

Now we begin the most interesting part, adding content models to the stackbit.yaml file. These models are necessary for CMS to understand your content in a structured way. There are a few types of content models — page models, data models, field models and object models. We use page models to map all our pages, data models to map everything that is inside the data directory and in the config.yml file, and field models to define individual fields of page, data and object models.

Before we begin creating content models, let's create the list of what kind of content and data we have in our theme and what kind of models we will use for it:

**Page Models**

- Posts
- Pages
- Tags page
- 404 page

**Data Models**

- Author information
- Social links
- config.yml

To start creating content models, add `models:` to the stackbit.yaml file below the `pageTemplateKey: layout` field. All other models (page, data and object) are nested under this field:

    stackbitVersion: "~0.2.0"
    ssgName: jekyll
    staticDir: ""
    uploadDir: images
    buildCommand: "gem install jekyll bundler && bundle install && bundle exec jekyll build"
    publishDir: "_site"
    dataDir: ""
    pagesDir: ""
    pageTemplateKey: layout
    models:

### Create Models for config.yml Options

The config file in our theme has quite a few options and we need them to be accessible in CMS. So we create the config model and specify its type, label, file and fields:

    models:
      config:
        type: data
        label: Config
        file: _config.yml
        fields:

Under the fields key we specify options of the config file. For example, let's define the `lang` option

    # Site language
    lang: en-US

in the stackbit.yaml file:

    models:
      config:
        type: data
        label: Config
        file: _config.yml
        fields:
          - type: string
            name: lang
            label: Site Language
            description: The language of the site used in HTML lang attribute.

Let's explore the fields we just added as we will keep using this pattern. Fields `type` and `name` are required. Field `name` should be the same as the option in the `_config.yml` file of our theme. Field `type` should specify what type of data CMS can expect from this model. For example, the `string` type will create a single-line plain text input field, the `boolean` type a true/false toggle, the `image` type an image upload widget, etc. Field `label` should have a short, human-readable label for the field. Field `description` is optional, but I recommend you to add it to make it easier for the user to navigate CMS.

Following the same pattern, we model other options from the \_config.yml file:

    models:
      config:
        type: data
        label: Config
        file: _config.yml
        fields:
          - type: color
            name: accent_color
            label: Accent Color
            description: The accent color of the theme.
            required: true
          - type: string
            name: lang
            label: Site Language
            description: The language of the site used in HTML lang attribute.
          - type: string
            name: title
            label: Site Title
            description: The title displayed in the site header, title tag, search-engine results.
          - type: string
            name: description
            label: Description
            description: The default description displayed in meta tags, search-engine results.
          - type: string
            name: baseurl
            label: Baseurl
            description: The subpath of your site, e.g. /blog, for generating urls.
          - type: string
            name: url
            label: Url
            description: The base hostname and protocol of your site for where absolute urls are needed.
          - type: string
            name: permalink
            label: Permalink
            description: The permalink pattern.
          - type: image
            name: favicon
            label: Favicon
            description: The icon image associated with your website.
          - type: string
            name: disqus
            label: Disqus Username
            description: The shortname for your Disqus site to enable comments.

There are few options in `_config.yml` that are more complex. Let's take a closer look at them. Here is how navigation is defined in the \_config.yml file:

    # _config.yml
    ...
    # Site navigation - each item must have a title and a url.
    navigation:
      - text: Home
        url: /
      - text: About
        url: /about/
      - text: Style Guide
        url: /style-guide/
      - text: Tags
        url: /tags/
      - text: Download
        url: https://github.com/JustGoodThemes/Scriptor-Jekyll-Theme

Since this is the array of items, we will use type `list`. Each navigation item is described by text and url fields and to model navigation items we will use type `object`:

    # stackbit.yaml

    - type: list
      name: navigation
      label: Header Navigation
      items:
        type: object
        labelField: text
        fields:
          - type: string
            name: text
            label: Title
            required: true
          - type: string
            name: url
            label: URL
            required: true

Next, we have the list of plugins the theme uses:

    # Plugins
    plugins:
      - jekyll-paginate

Since this is the array, we will use type `list` again, and to model the plugin items we specify type `string` as this is a simple list of strings:

    - type: list
      name: plugins
      label: Plugins
      items:
        type: string

Now we have the site footer and Sass configuration options left:

    # Site footer
    footer:
      content: "&copy; Scriptor all rights reserved. Theme by [JustGoodThemes](https://www.justgoodthemes.com)."
      has_social: true

    # Sass
    sass:
      sass_dir: _sass
      style: compressed

To model them, we use already familiar type `object`:

    - type: object
      name: footer
      label: Footer Configuration
      fields:
        - type: markdown
          name: content
          label: Footer Content
          description: The copyright text displayed in the footer.
        - type: boolean
          name: has_social
          label: Enable social links?
          default: true

    - type: object
      name: sass
      label: Sass Configuration
      hidden: true
      fields:
        - type: string
          name: sass_dir
          label: Sass Files Directory
        - type: string
          name: style
          label: Style

One thing to note regarding the Sass field model, I've added the `hidden: true` field since I want this option to be hidden in CMS. This option is not important and I don't want to overwhelm theme users with too many choices.

### Create Models for \_data Directory Contents

In the `_data` directory of the theme we have two files — author.json and social.json. Let's start with author.json that contains the author data:

    {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "bio": "John is a designer, photographer, speaker, author of a couple of books about typography and the founder of photo magazine Curious.",
      "url": "http://justgoodthemes.com",
      "location": "Vilnius, Lithuania",
      "image": "/images/author.png"
    }

Let's create a content model for it by specifying the type of the model, file path relative to the `_data` directory and the label:

    author:
      type: data
      file: "_data/author.json"
      label: Author

Next, we add the fields:

    author:
      type: data
      file: "_data/author.json"
      label: Author
      fields:
        - type: string
          name: name
          label: Name
          description: The name of the author.
        - type: markdown
          name: bio
          label: Bio
          description: The short bio of the author.
        - type: string
          name: url
          label: URL
          description: The URL of the author.
        - type: string
          name: location
          label: Location
          description: The location of the author.
        - type: image
          name: image
          label: Avatar
          description: The profile image of the author.

We specify the necessary types for our field models to let CMS know what kind of data it is and what to do with that data. For instance, we use `image` for the author avatar to create an image upload widget and `markdown` for the author bio to create a rich text input that will be run through markdownify filter.

Similarly we create the model for social.json.

    social:
      type: data
      file: "_data/social.json"
      label: Social Links
      fields:
        - type: list
          name: links
          label: Link
          description: A list of social links displayed in the footer.
          items:
            type: object
            labelField: title
            fields:
              - type: string
                name: title
                label: Title
                description: The title of the icon.
              - type: string
                name: icon
                label: Icon
                description: Font Awesome icon class name.
                required: true
              - type: string
                name: url
                label: URL
                description: The URL to your social profile.
                widget: url

### Create Model for Posts

Next, we will create the content model for our theme posts. This time we don't need to map a specific file or page, but instead we need to create a reusable abstraction `posts` as all our posts have the same front matter. Here is how the front matter from the post looks like:

    ---
    layout: post
    title: "The Advantages & Disadvantages of Working from Home"
    description: "A work at home parent is an entrepreneur who works from home and integrates parenting into his or her business activities."
    date: 2019-01-01
    feature_image: images/desk.jpg
    tags: [tips, work]
    ---

Let's create a content model for it. We will follow the same pattern as in previous content models, just this time we will use the page content model and additionally specify `template: post` to tell CMS what kind of template will be used for this model and `folder: _posts` to tell where our posts are located.

    post:
      type: page
      label: Post
      template: post
      folder: _posts

Now under the `fields` key we will define all the data from the post front matter:

    post:
      type: page
      label: Post
      template: post
      folder: _posts
      fields:
        - name: title
          type: string
          label: Title
          description: The title of the post
          required: true
        - name: description
          type: string
          label: Description
          description: The description used in meta tags.
        - name: date
          type: date
          label: Date
          description: The publish date of the post.
          required: true
        - name: feature_image
          type: image
          label: Feature image
          description: The featured image of the post.
        - name: tags
          type: list
          label: Tags
          items:
            type: string

### Create Model for Pages

Next, we will create a reusable model for theme pages. It will be similar to the posts model, just this time we don't need to specify the folder where the pages are as they are stored in the theme root directory and the front matter doesn't have fields like tags and date. Let's look at the front matter of the theme pages:

    ---
    layout: page
    title: About this blog
    description: An optional about page for Scriptor Jekyll theme
    feature_image: images/about.jpg
    ---

And the model for this front matter will be:

    page:
      type: page
      label: Page
      template: page
      fields:
        - type: string
          name: title
          label: Title
          description: The title of the page.
          required: true
        - type: string
          name: description
          label: Description
          description: The description used in meta tags.
        - name: feature_image
          type: image
          label: Feature image
          description: The featured image of the page.

### Create Model for the Tags Page

Since our tag page uses different layout we have to create a separate model for it. Here is how the front matter for the tag page looks:

    ---
    layout: tags
    title: Tags
    description: A tags page for Scriptor Jekyll theme
    ---

Let's define the model for it:

    tags:
      type: page
      label: Tags Page
      template: tags
      file: tags.md
      hideContent: true
      singleInstance: true
      fields:
        - type: string
          name: title
          label: Title
          required: true
        - type: string
          name: description
          label: Description
          description: The description used in meta tags.

The model is the very similar to the one we defined for the theme pages, it just has few additional fields. Since there can be only one instance of tag pages, we specify `singleInstance: true`. If `singleInstance` is set to true, we need to specify the file as well, i.e. `file: tags.md`. Also, as this page doesn't have markdown content, we specify `hideContent: true` to hide the content input in the CMS.

### Create Model the Error 404 Page

We will finish page models with the 404 page. This is the front matter from the 404 page:

    ---
    layout: page
    title: Page Not Found
    permalink: /404.html
    feature_image: images/404.jpg
    ---

Now we will create a new page model "notfound" and specify the necessary fields like in previous models:

    notfound:
      type: page
      label: 404 Page
      singleInstance: true
      file: 404.md
      template: page
      fields:
        - type: string
          name: title
          label: Title
          description: The title of the page.
          required: true
        - type: string
          name: description
          label: Description
          description: The description used in meta tags.
        - name: feature_image
          type: image
          label: Feature image
          description: The featured image of the page.
        - type: string
          name: permalink
          label: Permalink
          description: The permalink of the page.

## Validate Our Theme with the Stackbit CLI Validator

Now when we have defined all content models for our theme, let's run the validator again (`unibit validate`) and check if we haven't missed anything.

    Validating Model
    ✔ loading stackbit.yaml
    ✔ validating stackbit.yaml fields
    ✔ models.config
    ✔ models.author
    ✔ models.social
    ✔ models.post
    ✔ models.page
    ✔ models.tags
    ✔ models.notfound

    Loading Theme
    ssgName: jekyll

    Site Configuration
      stackbitVersion: "~0.2.0"
      ssgName: "jekyll"
      buildCommand: "gem install jekyll bundler && bundle install && bundle exec jekyll build"
      publishDir: "_site"
      staticDir: ""
      dataDir: ""
      pagesDir: ""
      pageLayoutKey: "layout"
    ...

    Validating Data
    ✔ _config.yml
    ✔ author.json
    ✔ social.json

    Validating Pages
    ✔ matching pages to models
    ✔ notfound ⇔ 404.md
    ✔ post ⇔ _posts/2019-01-01-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-working-from-home.md
    ✔ post ⇔ _posts/2019-01-02-set-up-your-new-iphone-6-the-Right-Way.md
    ✔ post ⇔ _posts/2019-01-03-basic-rules-for-walking-in-the-mountains.md
    ✔ post ⇔ _posts/2019-01-04-a-week-with-the-apple-watch.md
    ✔ post ⇔ _posts/2019-01-05-Graphic-Designer-On-The-Road.md
    ✔ page ⇔ about.md
    ✔ page ⇔ style-guide.md
    ✔ tags ⇔ tags.md

    ℹ All OK

Our theme has passed the validation and now we are ready to import it into Stackbit.

## Import the Converted Theme to Stackbit and Connect to a CMS of Your Choice

Visit <https://app.stackbit.com/create> and import your theme.

![Import theme to Stackbit.com](/images/1567335212-import-theme-to-stackbit.png)

Stackbit will check the theme again, and if everything is OK, you can select the CMS you want and let Stackbit connect your theme to the CMS and deploy it to Netlify.

## Trying Out Different CMSs the Easy Way

With Stackbit and Uniform theme (a theme with the stackbit.yaml file), you can explore different CMSs quick and easy. For example, if you have never tried Dato or Contentful CMS before, you can do it now with just a few clicks and see if these CMS's are the right choice for you.

## Conclusion

This Jekyll Uniform theme tutorial was quite long but hopefully you’ve seen that Jekyll and Stackbit make an incredible duo for spinning rapid JAMstack sites on Netlify. Don’t stop here! I encourage you to further explore [Uniform Themes](https://docs.stackbit.com/uniform/) and tinker with Stackbit on your own.
