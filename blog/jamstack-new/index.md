# Introducing jamstack.new

Eduardo BouÃ§as â€” October 05, 2020

We're excited to announce a nifty little shortcut for creating new Jamstack sites: here's [jamstack.new](https://jamstack.new/info).

## Introducing jamstack.new

A couple of months ago, our friends at CodeSandbox [announced a cool set of domains](https://twitter.com/compuives/status/1291020566221205511) that allow anyone to instantly create a project with a specific stack.

Off the back of this announcement, [Dave Darnes](https://twitter.com/daviddarnes) floated the idea of having a `.new` domain as a launchpad for the Jamstack. This made me go frantically check whether a very special keyword had already been taken â€“ to my absolute surprise, [jamstack.new](https://jamstack.new/info) was still available. We had to get it!

I shared this in our company Slack, pitching it in a very calm matter. It's just a domain, after all. I do _NOT_ get overly excited about domain names.

Sure enough, we got the domain and we're putting it to good use. Do you need a new Jamstack site? Simple! Head to [jamstack.new](https://jamstack.new). ðŸŒˆ

## Choose your flavor

We built this as a tool for the community to use. You don't need to memorize the right combinations of tools to pick or the install commands needed to get them working â€“ your next site is just one catchy URL away.

If you have a solid idea about what you want to build or what tools you want to build it with, we have that covered too. Do you need a [jamstack.new/blog](https://jamstack.new/blog) or a [jamstack.new/portfolio](https://jamstack.new/portfolio), using [jamstack.new/gatsby](https://jamstack.new/gatsby) or [jamstack.new/hugo](https://jamstack.new/hugo), powered by [jamstack.new/contentful](https://jamstack.new/contentful) or [jamstack.new/git](https://jamstack.new/git)? Your choice.

Regardless of what you pick, there's a fully-configured Jamstack site waiting for you on the other side, with a complete editing experience powered by [Stackbit Studio](https://jamstack.new/).

Check all the available combinations at <https://jamstack.new/info>. We're constantly working on adding more, so if your favorite tool isn't supported yet, please [let us know](https://twitter.com/stackbit).
