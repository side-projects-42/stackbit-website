# 10 of the Best Gatsby Themes

Brian Rinaldi â€” June 15, 2020

Exploring some of the best options for free and open source Gatsby themes to help you get started on your next Gatsby Jamstack site.

One of Gatsby's strengths is in the size of its community and ecosystem of plugins. This means that there are many themes for Gatsby developers to choose from as a starting point for their new project. I listed my 10 favorites Gatsby themes below, in order of quality based on aesthetics and features like CMS support, unique capabilities, etc.

## [Azimuth SaaS/Business by Stackbit](https://app.stackbit.com/create?theme=azimuth&utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=gatsbythemes)

**Supported CMS**: Sanity, Contentful, Git

This is one of my favorite Stackbit templates. It's designed for a business like a SaaS service, for example, so it is fully featured and extremely versatile, packed with modules and feature options. It also looks great on mobile which is very important. To use this theme with Gatsby, head over to [Stackbit](https://app.stackbit.com/create?theme=azimuth&utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=gatsbythemes) and get started for free. From there you'll get a fully-functioning Azimuth Gatsby site in about 60 seconds, and you'll be able to easily edit it on the Stackbit Studio.
