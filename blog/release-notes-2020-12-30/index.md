Dwayne McDaniel — December 30, 2020

New this week:

- [Inline Editing](#inline)
- [Updates to the Azimuth Theme](#azimuth)

## <span id="inline">Inline Editing</span>

[![Inline editing in action in the Stackbit Studio](/images/blog/on-page-edit-screenshot.png)](https://youtu.be/o5a41k3ESMo) You can now modify any element on a page in the Stackbit Studio simply by clicking on it and directly editing it in place. Just click on what you want to change and edit right from the page itself. The Studio will let you click on a string and immediately start typing, click on an image to choose a new one, and so many other element-specific actions — right from where you are working on the screen.

There’s more you can do from the inline editing feature, too. For example, the More button reveals various modifications you can make to the properties of an element and its surrounding module.

Clicking Open in Sidebar takes you to the appropriate location for more structural changes, like rearranging elements, adding new ones, or deleting them altogether.
