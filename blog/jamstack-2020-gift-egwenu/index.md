What to Expect from the JAMstack in 2020 - Gift Egwuenu
=======================================================

Brian Rinaldi â€” December 17, 2019

Gift Egwenu discusses the growth of the JAMstack community in 2020 and the continued impact of the growing adoption of serverless architectures on JAMstack application development.

2019 definitely seemed to be a pivotal year for the JAMstack. New companies cropped up (yep, [us included](https://www.stackbit.com/)), [JAMstack*conf*sf](https://jamstackconf.com/sf/) was the biggest event yet and lots of new tools seemed to gain momentum daily. In this series of posts, we're asking some well-known members of the JAMstack community what they thought about this past year and what they think you can expect for the year to come. This edition features [Gift Egwuenu](https://twitter.com/lauragift21).

### Tell us about yourself and what you do? Does JAMstack play a role in your day-to-day work?

I work as a Software Engineer at Andela. I also do a lot of content creation from writing on my [personal blog](https://www.giftegwuenu.com/) to creating helpful video content on YouTube. Unfortunately, I don't work with JAMstack in my full-time job but I work with it a lot on my personal projects and over time I'm constantly amazed by how much I can achieve with this stack!

### What is your current JAMstack stack? What tool(s) have you most excited?

I've dabbled with a couple of JAMstack tools in the past. My first ever introduction to the JAMstack was when I created the first iteration of my blog with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). At the time I wasn't aware that JAMstack existed. I currently work with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) and I leverage all the amazing services available for me to use. Two services I'm loving at the moment are [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) for media and assets management and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) which is a git-based CMS.

### What changes did you see, for better or worse, in 2019 related to the JAMstack ecosystem?

I saw a significant rise in the adoption of the JAMstack which is really interesting to watch coming from a place where I wasn't even familiar a couple of years ago. More companies are now adopting the architecture and, not only that, I've also seen a bunch of developers working with the JAMstack - the community is growing rapidly. I think this makes it exciting and I'm looking forward to seeing how it grows significantly over the next couple of years.

### What changes in 2020 do you see forthcoming that will have an impact on adoption of or day-to-day development using the JAMstack?

I've noticed a lot of serverless architecture adoption going on this year. I think that isn't going to stop anytime soon. I'm also looking forward to learning about all the amazing services we can leverage to boost the functionalities of projects built using the JAMstack. I don't want to jinx it but I'm also looking forward to more job openings on the JAMstack.
