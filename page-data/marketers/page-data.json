                    "answer": "In most cases, this occurs on projects using Git as a CMS and is due to changes being made to the `master` branch but not the `preview` branch. The most efficient way to solve this is to merge any changes that have been made to `master` into the `preview` branch.\n\n``` git checkout preview\ngit merge master ```\n\nIt is recommended that you make edits directly to the `preview` branch. These will be pushed to `master` - along with your content changes - when you click publish in the Studio.\n\nIf this fails to resolve your issue or the issue you are encountering is different from the one described above, please [contact support](mailto:support@stackbit.com)."

                    "answer": "Usually this error means that there's a setup error between Stackbit and an API-based CMS like Contentful or Sanity. Typically, this is the result of the Stackbit API key not being set or being incorrectly set.\n\nTo see what value is set for `STACKBIT_API_KEY` environment variable, run `printenv STACKBIT_API_KEY` from the terminal/command-line. The value should only contain letters and numbers and should _not_ contain the curly brackets (i.e. `{` and `}`).\n\nAnother option is to run `npx @stackbit/stackbit-pull`, which pulls the content locally from the API-based CMS, with your Stackbit API key appended via the `--stackbit-api-key=` paremeter.\n\nOnce the content is properly pulled, you should be able to run your site locally without errors.\n\nIf this fails to resolve your issue or the issue you are encountering is different from the one described above, please [contact support](mailto:support@stackbit.com)."

This message lets you know how many changes have been saved and are ready to be deployed.\n\nIf you're working only through the Studio you should always see either `preview is ahead of master` or simply `preview` in case no edits have been made yet.\n\nOnce you publish, `preview` is merged into `master`. At this point, the `preview` branch will no longer be ahead of the published site and the message will update to reflect this.\nIf you work directly against the `master` branch outside of the Studio, then you can get to a state where `preview is x commits behind master`.\n\nIf you are modifying both through the Studio and editing your repository directly, you will reach a state where you will need to sync `master` with `preview` manually.  If this happens you will see this menu appear when you click the `preview` message in the studio:\n\n![The preview and live site are out of synch](/images/support/preview-and-live-site-are-out-of-sync.png)\n\nFollow the provided link to merge `master` into `preview` on Github.\n\nIf you're making only code changes when editing the `master` branch, this should not cause issues, as the Studio is restricted to editing content."

                    "question": "Should I delete my preview branch after merging? ",
                    "answer": "Short answer: No\n\nIf you are using a git based CMS (Git, NetlifyCMS, Forestry) the `preview` branch is a special branch that Stackbit Studio uses to store the changes you make when editing.\n\nIf you are merging manually on Github it is easy to delete the branch after merging as their workflow will suggest is it 'safe to delete' it.  Please don't.\n\nIf you have deleted this branch, it is simple to to fix. All you need to do is recreate the branch from `master` and it should work as expected.\n"

This is done for security purposes to avoid requesting intrusive permissions on user's GitHub accounts. In these cases, Stackbit will initially generate a project under a Stackbit owned GitHub account (i.e.`stackbit-projects`) and then initiate a transfer of the repository to your GitHub account.
