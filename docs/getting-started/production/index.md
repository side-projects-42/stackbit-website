Publish to Production
=====================

Clicking the **Publish** button merges your repository's `preview` branch to its `main` branch. This merge triggers a Netlify Build webhook, which kicks off the new build. Let's try it out.

4.  Click **Publish** again in the top nav. Then click **Publish** in the dropdown.
5.  Click the **Settings gear icon** in the left of the top nav.
6.  Next to Netlify, click **Open**.
7.  Under the **Production deploys** card, you'll see the build labeled **Building**. Click it.
8.  Here you can watch the deploy finish.
9.  Once the build is complete, navigate to back to the live site.

You can deploy to whichever hosting platform you desire by changing the build webhook in your Github repository.
