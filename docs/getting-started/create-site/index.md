Create a New Site
=================

Let's create a site to use with this tutorial. Begin by clicking the big blue button below!

[![Create with Stackbit](https://assets.stackbit.com/badge/create-with-stackbit.svg)](https://stackbit.com/create?theme=https://github.com/stackbit-themes/universal-nextjs/)

<a href="#configure_your_site" class="hash-link"><span class="icon-copy"></span></a>Configure Your Site
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Atop the page, change your Stackbit **project name** to `My First Site`.
2.  Click **Create Site**.
3.  If you don't have an account yet, sign up for a new account. While you work through the registration process, Stackbit is doing some fancy stuff to prepare your site for you.

‚öôÔ∏è Learn what Stackbit's site creation does for you.  

After you click **Create Site**, Stackbit:

1.  **Creates a new GitHub repository** by cloning the original repository into your GitHub account, creating a `preview` branch for it as well.
2.  **Creates a new Contentful Space** and provisions that Space with initial content from the `export.json` file in the original repository.
3.  **Creates a Netlify site**.
4.  **Creates webhooks between GitHub and Netlify** so that whenever something is committed into GitHub, it will trigger a deploy in Netlify.

**üéâ Pat yourself on the back because you just deployed a Jamstack website! üéâ**

Yeah, seriously. That's it! You can now play around with your new site and see what Stackbit can do for you. Or, use the link at the bottom of this guide to continue on a guided Stackbit journey.
