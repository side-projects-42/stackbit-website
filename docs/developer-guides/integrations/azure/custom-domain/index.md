Custom Domain on Azure
======================

If you have deployed your site to Azure Static Web Apps, [here are the instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/custom-domain?tabs=azure-dns) for adding a custom domain.

Azure also supports [hosting your domain](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/dns/), but you must register new domains elsewhere.
