Custom Domain on Netlify
========================

For users who authenticated with GitHub and are using Netlify, you will need to log into Netlify and add your custom domain there [using these instructions](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/configure-external-dns/).

Netlify also supports [registering new domains](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/netlify-dns/domain-registration/) if you don't already have one.
