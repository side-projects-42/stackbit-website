# Deploying Your Stackbit Site

By default, sites created with Stackbit will be deployed on Netlify. However, we also offer alternative methods depending on your platform of choice. See below.

## <a href="#supported_deployment_integrations" class="hash-link"><span class="icon-copy"></span></a>Supported Deployment Integrations

The following services are supported alternatives to Netlify:

- [Azure](/docs/developer-guides/integrations/azure/deploy/)
- [DigitalOcean](/docs/developer-guides/integrations/digital-ocean/deploy/)

**Note:** If you are importing an existing site into Stackbit and it is hosted in an unsupported platform, you will still be able to use our collaboration and editing tools, but you won't have the ability to see the logs.

## <a href="#accessing_connected_services" class="hash-link"><span class="icon-copy"></span></a>Accessing Connected Services

Stackbit Studio provides you the ability to view and access your connected services through [the settings](/docs/studio-guides/settings).
