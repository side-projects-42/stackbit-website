Debugging and Logs
==================

You site's build logs can be a useful tool when debugging issues that can occur during development, especially when making and committing changes [locally](/docs/studio-guides/accessing-code). Stackbit's studio editing environment gives you direct access to your full, most recent Netlify build logs without ever leaving the site.

To access your build logs click the "logs" button in the develop tools section at the bottom of the studio editing environment. This will open your most recent logs. As the logs are often quite long, you can even click to open them in a separate window for easier viewing.

Full historical build logs for your project builds can be accessed via your [Netlify dashboard](https://app.netlify.com/).
