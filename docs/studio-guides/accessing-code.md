Accessing Code
==============

Every Jamstack site built with Stackbit can be modified, customized and tested locally. You have full access to the code. Local development just requires some basic set up steps - all of which are provided directly from within Stackbit's studio editing environment.

To get specific instructions for developing your project locally, click on the develop locally button in the developer tools section at the bottom of Stackbit's studio editing environment.

You can choose either the SSH or HTTPS variations of the local environment commands. Click the copy button to copy the commands to your clipboard. From your local command-line/Terminal environment, navigate to the directory where you want to place the project folder. The commands that you copied to your clipboard will differ depending on the type of Stackbit project you created.

See [our developer guide](/docs/developer-guides/basics/local-development) for more tips on working locally.
