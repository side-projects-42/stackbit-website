Creating a Jamstack Site with Stackbit: A Great Alternative to GoDaddy Website Builder
======================================================================================

Stackbit vs. GoDaddy: Stackbit is a powerful GoDaddy alternative where you own your content and easily edit it. Here’s how Stackbit and GoDaddy compare to one another.

Nearly 1.5 million websites published on the internet today were created with GoDaddy Website Builder, and it's easy to see why. You get one company to handle your domain, hosting, and page-builder needs for an affordable price. It's also easy to use GoDaddy Website Builder's WYSIWYG page builder even if you have zero experience in web development. Entrepreneurs can even use GoDaddy Insight (an analytics tool based on the popular Google Analytics) to grow their business online. For beginners who just want to get a simple site off the ground, GoDaddy Website Builder is a good option.

Unfortunately, GoDaddy Website Builder isn't built to grow with its users’ needs. Available themes are lacking. All sites created with the service tend to look the same. Furthermore, social media integration and e-commerce capabilities are limited. As a result, many developers are turning to the Jamstack to get more freedom to create the site of their dreams. The biggest drawback of the Jamstack is that it can be daunting to use, especially for those with little back-end experience. Thankfully, we have created the Stackbit visual editor to make the advanced tools of the Jamstack more accessible to everyone: Marketers, developers, content creators and agencies.

What is Stackbit?
-----------------

Stackbit is the visual website editor for real businesses. If you're a developer, we make it easy to add Stackbit to your existing website and integrate with your stack, updating your tools behind the scenes while the website is edited. Stackbit also recognizes your website’s content model and helps you complete a content schema that will provide the right access to editors of your Jamstack site. 

If you want to create a Jamstack website from scratch, choose from one of [these Jamstack themes](http://jamstackthemes.dev/?utm_source=stackbit.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=alternative-to-godaddy) and connect your preferred headless content management system (CMS), deployment tools, and static site generator (SSG) to the Jamstack ecosystem to create a fast, secure website. We take pride in being brand-agnostic, so we'll never force you to use proprietary services or plugins if there's something else on the market you'd prefer.

If you're an agency marketer or freelancer who's tired of clients taking your sites offline because they tried to change something, Stackbit’s WYSIWYG [editing tool](https://www.stackbit.com/blog/announcing-stackbit-studio/) allows novices to make updates without touching code. Better yet, you can still up-sell existing clients with advanced features that take more development know-how to implement. Please continue reading if you would like to learn more about why Jamstack sites are a superior alternative to GoDaddy Website Builder.

Why should I choose a Jamstack site over GoDaddy Website Builder?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

It's easy to set up a website on GoDaddy Website Builder, but its rigid interface can make it difficult to edit your creation once it's live. GoDaddy also limits users to a small selection of themes, so sites created with it offer few customization options. Let's face it: It's tough to stand out in the marketplace if your website looks the same as all of your competitors. 

GoDaddy is praised for affordability, but their pricing structure can be misleading. Their basic package costs $10 per month, but that figure jumps to $15 if you want their SEO wizard, $20 for unlimited social media posts and online appointment functionality, and $25 for basic e-commerce capabilities. Many of these services are also lacking even if you pay the extra money. For example, there is currently no way for visitors to share your content automatically on their social media feeds, nor can you post a live feed of your social media channels. E-commerce is also hard-capped at 1,500 unique products, meaning that you could run into scalability issues growing your online store.

Stackbit and the Jamstack can solve all of these issues. Stackbit is an intuitive WYSIWYG editing tool that makes it easy to add new content to your site. You can even preview what your changes will look like before they go live. Stackbit is also compatible with the [thousands of themes](http://jamstackthemes.dev/?utm_source=stackbit.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=alternative-to-godaddy), plugins, and add-ons that already exist in the Jamstack ecosystem, and you can access your site's source code directly to extend functionality to your specifications. Our expert team has been involved with the Jamstack since its inception, so we're ready to answer any questions you have as well. 

How does Stackbit make Jamstack sites more accessible?
------------------------------------------------------

Working with the Jamstack can be complex, causing even experienced developers to shy away from using it (Not to mention business owners trying to manage their own site). Stackbit helps novices get started just as easily as GoDaddy. If you're an experienced developer looking for more flexibility than GoDaddy provides, you can link your favorite CMS, SSG, and development tools and create everything yourself. Unlike GoDaddy sites, you will always own your site's source code and can take it with you wherever you go.

Similarly, Stackbit is a powerful WYSIWYG editing tool that allows clients and stakeholders to perform day-to-day content management without extensive knowledge of coding. If you’re a marketer, you have much more independence in your website editing, and a powerful visual tool to help you see your changes as you go. If you're a business owner, you won't need to pay for an expert every time you want to adjust something. If you're a developer, you can leave content management to an employee and concentrate on other priorities. You can even hand the reins to your clients if you want to get started on other projects.

#### Here are some of the other features that help Stackbit stand out:

-   Built-in mobile responsiveness
-   SEO toolbox to easily add metadata, alt tags, and define social-media sharing elements on any webpage
-   Shareable unpublished pages
-   Advanced collaboration tools
-   Increased loading speeds (Jamstack sites are pre-rendered)
-   Best-in-businesses website security (Jamstack sites are far less vulnerable)
-   And much more

**The Final Word: Stackbit vs. GoDaddy Website Builder**
--------------------------------------------------------

GoDaddy Website Builder's biggest advantage is its ease of use, but that ease comes at the cost of versatility, scalability, and functionality. Stackbit smoothes the learning curve associated with Jamstack sites, putting some of the web's most powerful tools at your disposal whether you're an experienced developer or a beginner. Try it once and we're confident that you'll never want to build any other way.
