A Better Alternative to WordPress - Build a Jamstack site with Stackbit
=======================================================================

Stackbit vs. WordPress: Stackbit is a powerful WordPress alternative where you own your content and easily edit it. Here’s how Stackbit and WordPress compare to one another.

WordPress powers an estimated 455 million websites around the world, 35% of the web. While this popular content management system (CMS) provides convenience by way of familiarity, using WordPress to build your next site comes with both risks and limitations. In fact, research shows that up to 70% of [WordPress sites are vulnerable to attacks](https://www.wpwhitesecurity.com/statistics-70-percent-wordpress-installations-vulnerable/). As technology continues to move forward, many website designers and developers are moving to Jamstack, a way to create a site that doesn’t rely on a server-side CMS or other application to render pages in real time.

In this article, we’re going to show you how the Jamstack can be a great way for you to build a faster and more secure site. However, Jamstack architecture can be intimidating to non-developers –that’s where Stackbit comes in. 

What is Stackbit?
-----------------

Stackbit makes the Jamstack accessible to everyone. We’re the only complete platform for the Jamstack, and we respect your choices when it comes to building your site. Stackbit connects your Jamstack ecosystem to provide you with fast and secure infrastructure.

Stackbit Studio provides you, or your clients, with the ability to edit and add content to a site without coding. If you’re curious about the advantages of Jamstack vs. WordPress, read on to learn more. 

Is Jamstack a good alternative to WordPress?
--------------------------------------------

Jamstack sites have several advantages over WordPress. Getting the functionality you want out of WordPress usually means relying on third party plugins that vary greatly in  quality and may not be properly maintained. Frequent updates to WordPress and plugins require regular attention because they often address newly discovered security flaws and bugs. If you have a plugin that’s vital to your website’s operation, you may need to wait until that plugin is updated before you can perform a critical WordPress update, leaving your site vulnerable in the interim. Likewise, as updates are released, they may require server maintenance to keep parts of the LAMP stack WordPress runs on, compatible. In addition to these security risks and the extra work it takes to keep your site and server up to date, WordPress tends to produce slow-loading websites because each page must be generated upon user request. The monolithic nature of WordPress’ all-in-one database, application, and site infrastructure is outdated, and modern development workflows have moved beyond it.

The Jamstack creates safer sites with exceptional speed, scaling ability, security, and ease of use by separating the building blocks of a website from the end product. Unlike most WordPress sites, Jamstack sites are pre-rendered, which means all of that work is done beforehand so they can load in a browser faster. This makes them ideal for situations where your site is experiencing high traffic. A pre-rendered site eliminates many of the security risks that can open up when delivering dynamic sites too. 

Stackbit makes building a Jamstack site easier. When creating a Jamstack site using Stackbit, developers don’t have to manually set up their environment and connect their tools. Instead, they can choose their preferred headless CMS, static site generator (SSG), and deployment tools to create a site in 60 seconds or less.

Are Jamstack sites more secure than sites built with WordPress?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Jamstack sites eliminate the many security risks associated with a server side CMS, making them a more secure alternative to WordPress. WordPress requires database calls and real time code execution in order to deliver a site to the user. This opens up a variety of opportunities for bad actors to interfere. The Jamstack protects against this via pre-rendered static pages, limiting the potential inroads for hackers. WordPress’ ubiquity also makes it a tempting target for hackers. As frequent security updates are released, it triggers the need for complementary updates in any third-party plugins. If these plugins aren’t updated, they could leave your or your client’s site vulnerable. 

Whether you’re a marketing or web development agency looking to build client satisfaction or you’re just looking for a great way to boost your site’s performance, Jamstack websites are a smart alternative to WordPress. From security to user experience, the Jamstack offers many improvements over WordPress, and Stackbit Studio makes these benefits accessible to everyone.
