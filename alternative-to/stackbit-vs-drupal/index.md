# Why the Jamstack Is the Ultimate Alternative to Drupal

Stackbit vs. Drupal: Stackbit is a powerful Drupal alternative where you own your content and easily edit it. Here’s how Stackbit and Drupal compare to one another.

Drupal is a powerful, customizable content management system (CMS). It is intended primarily for web developers at organizations who need control over user management and who have many content types. It also includes a multitude of features that large organizations  value, including a strong emphasis on security and immediate multilingual support. Most importantly, Drupal can be also scalable so that a company's website can grow and support many concurrent visitors. Nearly 600,000 websites available today were developed on Drupal, and it's easy to see why.

That said, Drupal has some significant warts. It has a very steep learning curve and it’s built on an older tech stack, so companies need to invest in a dedicated development team to maintain it or pick up technical skills themselves. The open-source software is marketed as “free,” but the cost of building and extending modules to expand functionality can add up quickly. If you want the power of Drupal without the corresponding headache, a Jamstack site managed by Stackbit is the solution you have been searching for.

## What is the Stackbit platform?

The Stackbit platform is the world's first user-friendly interface for the Jamstack, one of the most powerful collections of web development tools you can find. The [Stackbit Site Builde](https://app.stackbit.com/create)r offers a collection of themes to help novices build a great site with minimal technological expertise. If you lack the coding expertise required to manage a Drupal site, Stackbit Studio is a WYSIWYG editing tool that allows you to make updates without ever touching source code. You'll be amazed at how easy creating and maintaining a website can be.

Stackbit also includes several features to help professional web developers make the most of their talents. It's brand-agnostic, so you are free to import your favorite headless CMS, SSG, and development tools into the Jamstack ecosystem through the Stackbit Site Builder. You can also up-sell advanced features to clients who are otherwise managing their own site using Stackbit Studio. Many developers even allow less-experienced employees to handle content management so that they can concentrate on new projects.

## Why is a Jamstack site a great Drupal alternative?

Drupal is an excellent page-builder, but the costs associated with using it can hurt a company's profitability. The software receives multiple updates per year that must be installed manually. The people in charge of the installation need to be tech-savvy, and the process could take hours depending on the size of the update. Furthermore, there is no backward compatibility between Drupal 8 and Drupal 7, meaning that you could need to recreate any custom elements all over again. In contrast, the Jamstack offers many of the same tools as Drupal.

Drupal sites can be slow to load unless you invest in a great infrastructure. Visitors won't wait 30 seconds for your page to load; they'll simply take their business elsewhere if it takes too long. Jamstack sites are stored as a cohesive whole in your headless CMS and rendered quickly by your SSG, making them much faster by comparison. This structure also leaves hackers with relatively few points of entry, making for more secure sites than Drupal's frequent security patches that you may or may not have the personnel to manually install.

## How does the Stackbit platform make Jamstack sites easier to work with?

The most common criticism of the Jamstack is that it has been difficult to work with. You needed development experience to splice together a headless CMS, SSG, and development tools into a single entity, and even then the process was challenging. Drupal suffers from the same shortcoming, and they introduced drag-and-drop functionality to make their software more accessible in Drupal 9. Unfortunately, it still has a very steep learning curve that forces individuals without extensive programming experience to pay for outside help whenever updates are needed.

Stackbit solves this problem by introducing an intuitive Site Builder and [Studio](https://www.stackbit.com/blog/announcing-stackbit-studio/) that allows marketers and business owners to manage their Jamstack sites without accessing code and running the risk of taking it offline entirely.

Stackbit also offers tools to make it easier to manage your Jamstack site. For example you can share unpublished pages with the other members of your team to facilitate a collaborative learning environment. Jamstack sites often offer built-in mobile responsiveness, and you can get live previews of site edits. You can even see how your site will be rendered as a web page, mobile site, or app. Here are some of Stackbit’s other top-notch features:

- Collaboration tools
- Front-end modular editing
- Development tools
- Freedom to import your own theme to modify
- And much more

## Jamstack vs. Drupal: The Final Word

Unlike many competing CMS solutions, Drupal has the capability to compete with the Jamstack. The difference lies in how expensive that capability is to access, how user-friendly it is to unlock, and the older technology it uses. With the addition of the Stackbit platform, it makes it easier than ever to create your own Jamstack site.
