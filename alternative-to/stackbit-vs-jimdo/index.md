# What Makes Jamstack Sites Better than Jimdo Sites

Stackbit vs. Jimdo: Stackbit is a powerful Jimdo alternative where you own your content and easily edit it. Here’s how Stackbit and Jimdo compare to one another.

Jimdo is a page-builder that offers separate services for web developers and novices. Developers can use Jimdo Creator to create a web page that suits their needs, while Jimdo Dolphin uses a series of questions to automatically generate a site for less experienced users. Either way, Jimdo sites are modern-looking and generally perform fairly well on speed tests. The Jimdo CMS (or content management system) values ease of use in all of its products as well. It's not hard to see why over 400,000 Jimdo sites are on the web today.

That said, Jimdo's emphasis on ease of use compromises its functionality. It is impossible to customize some of their templates, forcing you to live with a site that doesn't look as good as it could. Its online store is only compatible with Paypal payment processing, limiting your potential e-commerce capabilities. Costs can add up over time, and the CMS lacks several important SEO options. If you're looking for a more powerful page-builder, the Jamstack managed by Stackbit is a better option.

## What is Stackbit and who is it intended for?

Stackbit is the first complete platform designed for the Jamstack, helping developers and those without coding expertise make use of the web's most powerful development tools. The Stackbit Site Editor allows novices to choose from a variety of themes to get online quickly and easily. There are also plenty of customization options to transform your starting theme into something uniquely your own. You can also import a custom theme to the Jamstack using Stackbit Site Editor.

Once you have a site, you can use the Stackbit Studio to update it. Stackbit Studio is a WYSIWYG editing tool that even novices can effectively utilize, so [small business owners](https://www.stackbit.com/businesses) don't need to pay for professional help every time they need to change something. If you're a developer interested in including extra features on a site, Stackbit allows you to leverage your skills to create features that clients wouldn't be able to on their own. Please keep reading to find out more about the Jamstack's ability to make the web, better.

## Why is the Jamstack a Better Option than Jimdo?

One of Jimdo's biggest shortcomings is a lack of options. Many templates only allow you to select different images and text, forcing you to stick with the core structure they provide. Furthermore, you only have complete SEO control over your home page. Every other page is thrown into one awkward group that can make it difficult to rank higher than your competitors. In comparison, the Jamstack provides developers with unmatched flexibility. You can arrange the elements of your site however you like, and [optimize each individual page for search engines](https://www.stackbit.com/blog/seo-tools/).

Jimdo can also hit you with a lot of fees that can add up to a significant cost. Their free package forces you to stick a Jimdo ad in your footer and use a jimdosite.com subdomain, making your site look unprofessional. Their Start option costs $9 per month to get rid of the Jimdo branding and access customer support. Their Grow plan costs $15 per month and adds personalized customer support and SEO help. Their Unlimited plan includes professional design analysis and unlimited storage for $39 per month. You can also pay extra for hosting, additional analytics, and the privilege of using Jimdo Dolphin.

If you want to open an online store in the United States, Jimdo isn’t the best option. They offer e-commerce capabilities, but your customers can only check out using PayPal or manual payment. If you want greater flexibility, the choice is easy.

## How does Stackbit make the features of the Jamstack more accessible?

Jamstack sites consist of a headless CMS, a static site generator (or SSG), and additional tools for versioning, hosting, and more. This structure improves Jamstack site performance because it can be stored and loaded as a whole instead of as separate components. Having to put these building blocks together can be challenging for developers though, and those without coding experience have little chance without help. Stackbit provides that help through theStackbit Studio WYSIWYG editing tool offering guidance to less experienced users while staying out of a developer's way. Stackbit strives to be brand-agnostic, so you can use your preferred development tools instead of relying on anything proprietary.

Stackbit also offers several features to make it easier to create and manage your site. For example, you can share unpublished pages with your team to get feedback before they go live. You can even see live previews of changes on the desktop and mobile versions of your site.

You will always own your site's code, meaning that you can take it with you wherever you like. Jimdo sites aren't quite yours because their entire model depends on how easy their templates (not yours) are to use. Here are some additional benefits of Stackbit:

- [SEO toolbox](https://www.stackbit.com/blog/seo-tools/) to easily add metadata, alt tags, and define social-media sharing elements on any webpage.
- Front-end modular editing
- Collaboration tools
- Developmental tools
- Built-in mobile responsiveness

## Conclusion

Jimdo is an easy CMS to use, but it isn't the best. Their templates can compromise a developer's flexibility, their SEO and e-commerce options are lacking, and all of the fees can take a bite out of your bottom line. Instead, we recommend a Jamstack site managed by Stackbit. Try it once and you'll never want to build any other way.
