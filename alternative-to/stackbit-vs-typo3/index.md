The Jamstack: More Intuitive Alternative to TYPO3
=================================================

Stackbit vs. TYPO3: Stackbit is a powerful TYPO3 alternative where you own your content and easily edit it. Hereâ€™s how Stackbit and TYPO3 compare to one another.

Roughly 300,000 websites on the internet today were created using TYPO3. TYPO3 is a free, open-source content management system (or CMS). It has a modular design with thousands of extensions available, allowing users to pick the options they're looking for. TYPO3 is therefore quite versatile, allowing developers to create functional websites once they grasp the page-builder.

Unfortunately, TYPO3 is one of the most complex CMS options available. You need to know PHP to do any development with it, and many developers are moving on to JavaScript frameworks and other more modern development options. It also uses an exclusive internal typescript language called TypoScript that serves as an additional barrier to entry. Worst of all, TYPO3 is not easy to install and lacks dedicated customer support. If you are looking for a site that has the power of TYPO3 without the associated headache, a Jamstack site managed by Stackbit is a great solution for your needs.

What is Stackbit?
-----------------

Stackbit is the first complete platform for the Jamstack, providing an intuitive interface to anyone interested in working with the most powerful web development tools available. We created it with two audiences in mind. First, we want to equip developers seeking unlimited creativity with what they need to bring their vision to life. Second, we want [business owners](https://www.stackbit.com/businesses) to be able to edit their Jamstack site without professional assistance.

The Stackbit Site Editor accomplishes both of these goals. Web developers can [import an existing site to the Jamstack ecosystem](https://app.stackbit.com/import) or design their own theme to customize however they see fit. Novices can [select a theme](http://jamstackthemes.dev/?utm_source=stackbit.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=alternative-to-typo3) from a variety of options and follow easy guidelines to create a functional site that looks great on all devices.

Once your site is up and running, the Stackbit Studio WYSIWYG editing tool allows clients to make changes without accessing its HTML code, ensuring that they don't take it offline by mistake. Developers can also leverage their skills to create slick features that non-programmers wouldn't be able to, allowing sites to stand out more. Please continue reading to learn more about what the Jamstack can offer.

What makes the Jamstack such a good TYPO3 alternative?
------------------------------------------------------

TYPO3 may be a powerful CMS, but its ugly admin backend can be difficult for even experienced developers to work with. Any changes you want to make must be done via PHP, meaning you'll need to hire a PHP developer or add an advanced skill to your own resume. You'll also need to learn TypoScript, an internal typescript language that has no practical applications outside of TYPO3. Furthermore, TYPO3 is difficult to install and requires regular maintenance that must be performed by a tech-savvy individual. TYPO3 is free as open-source software, but the costs associated with maintaining it can quickly add up. TYPO3's modular structure also demands a top-notch server that may not fit into your budget.

The Jamstack offers the same versatility as TYPO3, and Stackbit makes it much easier to use. Jamstack sites are rendered by your SSG (static site generator) in seconds with content from your headless CMS of choice, and stored as whole pages on CDNs. Not only does this structure increase your site's performance, but it also provides hackers with fewer vulnerabilities to exploit. TYPO3 releases regular security patches to address weaknesses and TYPO3 sites remain vulnerable until they are installed.

The availability of support is also a huge plus in the Jamstack's favor. Considering how complex TYPO3 is, something will go awry. Meanwhile, our team has been working with the Jamstack since its inception, and we would be delighted to provide direct answers to any questions you have regarding it or Stackbit. Our documentation materials are also available to the public if you would prefer to figure it out for yourself.

How does Stackbit make TYPO3 more user-friendly?
------------------------------------------------

Jamstack sites are made by splicing together several building blocks such as a headless CMS, SSG, and other deployment tools. Doing this manually can be difficult, so we've created Stackbit to handle it instead. Stackbit is not a walled garden, so developers can use the tools they feel comfortable with. You can also [access your site's HTML code](https://www.stackbit.com/blog/vs-code-experience-to-stackbit-editor/) to expand its functionality to meet your needs. You own your site's code as well, so you are free to do whatever you wish with it.

The intuitive Stackbit Studio also allows developers to assign day-to-day content management to less experienced employees or even clients, freeing you up to work on new projects. TYPO3 sites require a developer's constant attention, making it difficult to take on new clients or expand a site's capabilities.

The increased accessibility of Jamstack sites managed by Stackbit also makes it easier to collaborate. You can share unpublished pages with your team to brainstorm ideas on how to improve them. Likewise, you can get previews of all site edits before they go live, ensuring that you don't accidentally compromise your site's mobile responsiveness while trying to add a new feature. Here are a few more reasons to choose Stackbit:

-   [SEO toolbox](https://www.stackbit.com/blog/seo-tools/) to easily add metadata, alt tags, and define social-media sharing elements on any webpage.
-   Front-end modular editing
-   Developmental tools
-   And so much more

The Verdict: Jamstack vs. TYPO3
-------------------------------

TYPO3 is a scalable CMS option capable of meeting a developer's needs, but its clunky interface and reliance on writing code for everything limits who can effectively utilize it. Jamstack sites managed by Stackbit provide comparable functionality in an intuitive package that everyone can use. We think the choice is clear: try Stackbit today and discover how to make the web, better.
