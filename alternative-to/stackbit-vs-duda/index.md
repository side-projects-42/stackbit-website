# Stackbit and the Jamstack: A Great Alternative to Duda

Stackbit vs. Duda: Stackbit is a powerful Duda alternative where you own your content and easily edit it. Here’s how Stackbit and Duda compare to one another.

Duda is a page-builder offering a variety of easy-to-use templates and extensions to create websites quickly. It is targeted towards marketing agencies and freelancers who need to create a lot of good-looking sites quickly. Duda sites include drag-and-drop functionality, analytical tools for SEO, and AWS hosting. It's no wonder that roughly 660,000 businesses use Duda sites today.

That said, Duda is not a perfect page-builder. Its ease of use can restrict what professional developers can do as they don't have the flexibility to place design elements wherever they wish. If you want more creative freedom and a lower bill, the Jamstack offers all of the tools you're searching for. Better yet, the Stackbit platform allows you to access those tools more easily than ever before.

## What is the Stackbit platform and who is it for?

We are big believers in the Jamstack infrastructure, but we understand that working with it can feel daunting. Therefore, we created Stackbit as a single intuitive platform that allows virtually anybody to access the best web development tools available. We envision two audiences for our Stackbit platform: developers seeking unlimited creativity and clients who just want an easy way to manage their Jamstack sites.

If you are a professional web developer, our [Stackbit Site Builder](https://app.stackbit.com/create) allows you to import your favorite headless CMS, SSG, and developmental tools to the Jamstack ecosystem. The [Stackbit Studio](https://www.stackbit.com/blog/announcing-stackbit-studio/) also allows clients or less-experienced employees to manage content on finished sites, enabling you to focus your attention elsewhere. If you're a novice, the Stackbit Site Builder offers a variety of templates and guidance to help you create a stunning website. Similarly, our WYSIWYG Stackbit Studio allows you to make changes to your site without any programming knowledge at all. Continue reading to learn more about why Jamstack sites managed by Stackbit are better than Duda.

## What advantages make Jamstack sites a great alternative to Duda?

Duda's page-builder includes several templates to act as the blueprints for your site, but you don't have that many options and you need to follow them to the letter. You are also limited in your slideshow and gallery options if your site highlights a visual product. In contrast, the Jamstack offers total freedom to create the site of your dreams. You can start with a theme if you like, but you're not locked into its core structure the same way you are with Duda. You can even import your own custom theme to help you express your message.

Duda’s costs add up. Their basic plan will run you $14 per month, and you're limited to email support and one administrator. Their team plan is a better deal at $22 per month because you can have up to four team members and additional support options. Their Agency package nets you four sites and up to 10 team members, but the cost continues to steepen at $33 per month. All of these numbers increase if you don't sign up for a full year, and e-commerce capabilities carry additional fees of up to $39 per month if you want to sell an unlimited number of products on your site.

Duda lacks basic marketing capabilities like email newsletter integration that the Jamstack can incorporate. Duda sites are also locked in as Duda sites, meaning that your entire website ceases to exist if you cancel your Duda subscription. With the Jamstack, you always retain ownership of your site's source code and can move it whenever and wherever you like.

## How does Stackbit make Jamstack sites more accessible?

Jamstack sites are created using a headless CMS (or content management system) to store your site, an SSG (static site generator) to render your site to users, and developmental tools. This structure increases speed and security because your site is stored as a cohesive pre-rendered unit, but can be time-consuming and challenging for developers to work with. Stackbit is an intuitive platform that allows everyone to enjoy the benefits of the Jamstack without having to put the building blocks together manually, easing the burden on professional developers while simultaneously making it accessible to marketers and entrepreneurs via Stackbit Studio.

As a developer, your time is very valuable. Stackbit Studio allows your clients or other staff members to manage site content in an easy WYSIWYG interface so you can focus on other priorities. Similarly, business owners will appreciate not needing to run to a pro every time they want to update their site.

Our platform offers several other benefits as well. Stackbit is a brand-agnostic tool, so you are free to incorporate all of your favorite programs from other page-builders to ours. Stackbit Studio also supports advanced collaborative features such as the ability to share unpublished pages to facilitate teamwork. You also get previews of site edits before they go live, ensuring that your site looks the way you want it to on all devices. Duda can do the same thing, but you need to edit separate templates for desktop, tablet, and mobile screens. That means that you're doing thrice the work for no discernible benefit.

Here are some of Stackbit’s other great features:

- Front-end modular editing
- [SEO toolbox](https://www.stackbit.com/blog/seo-tools/) to easily add metadata, alt tags, and define social-media sharing elements on any webpage.
- Developmental tools
- Built-in mobile responsiveness
- And more!

## Parting Thoughts: Jamstack vs. Duda

Duda isn't a bad page-builder, but it's missing a lot of features for one of the more costly products of its type on the market. The Jamstack allows for much more developer creativity and business features, and Stackbit makes them accessible to a broad audience.
