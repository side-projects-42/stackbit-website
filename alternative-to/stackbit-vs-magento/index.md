# Stackbit and the Jamstack: A Superior Alternative to Magento

Stackbit vs. Magento: Stackbit is a powerful Magento alternative where you own your content and easily edit it. Here’s how Stackbit and Magento compare to one another.

Magento is an open-source e-commerce platform targeted at online businesses. Several large companies choose it to host their online marketplaces because there are a lot of extensions available to give sites whatever their owners need. All told, there are approximately 250,000 Magento sites on the internet today.

Unfortunately, Magento’s interface can be difficult to work with if you lack web development experience, and even Magento developers find it time-consuming to implement certain features. There is a free version with limited features you can extend with plugins, while the professional version of Magento, an Adobe product, is a costly platform that many businesses simply cannot afford. If you're looking for a great e-commerce site without Magento's steep learning curve and price tag, look no further than a Jamstack site managed by Stackbit.

## What is Stackbit?

Stackbit is a user-friendly platform designed to make Jamstack sites more accessible to both developers tired of having their creativity stifled and business owners who would like to manage their websites. The Stackbit Site Editor allows novices to select a theme and customize it to create a great-looking, unique website. You don't have to type any code, making it ideal for those without programming experience. Developers can [import an existing site](https://app.stackbit.com/import) or create a custom theme from scratch, ensuring that they don't feel limited by the Stackbit Site Editor.

Once you have a site, you can manage it with Stackbit Studio. Stackbit Studio is a WYSIWYG editing tool that allows anybody to update a Jamstack site without touching its underlying code. If you've ever accidentally taken your site offline trying to make changes, you know how important this can be. Developers can also create slick features outside of Stackbit Studio that the average user could not, providing an opportunity to expand your customer base. You can also outsource everyday content management to your team, freeing you up to tackle fresh challenges. Please continue reading to find out more about the advantages provided by Jamstack sites.

## Why should I choose the Jamstack as a Magento alternative?

Magento sites have ugly admin panels, and the theme setup is complex and unintuitive. Unlike many competitors, Magento themes are intended to give developers a head start in creating a site rather than making site-building accessible to non-developers. If you don't have PHP experience, you'll almost certainly need to hire somebody who does to manage your site. Magento developers are always in-demand, so their services will not come cheap. In contrast, Stackbit makes it easy to create and manage a powerful Jamstack site. Updating a Magento site is also time-consuming even if you know what you're doing, so you can't be as agile as you could be with a Jamstack site.

Magento offers a free option, but it's difficult to recommend. Magento does not provide professional customer support to users with free Magento sites, meaning that you are solely responsible for your site's maintenance and security. Worse, all of the third-party plugins you'll need to add functionality to your free site are easy targets for hackers. Magento releases security patches whenever a vulnerability is detected, but hackers are often a couple of steps ahead. Jamstack sites are stored on your preferred headless content management system (CMS) and rendered as a cohesive whole by your static site generator (SSG), leaving hackers with fewer points of entry to work with. The structure of a Jamstack site also helps it load faster, capturing traffic that may navigate away if loading takes too long.

Magento Enterprise packages include dedicated customer support, but they can be prohibitively expensive. The company does not list pricing information on their website, so you'll have to listen to a sales pitch to get a quote for your needs. Depending on the size of your company, you could be looking at up to $50,000 per year. You'll also need a Magento developer to implement the advice you receive, and most Magento sites require high-end servers at an additional monthly cost to run optimally.

## How does Stackbit make Jamstack sites more user-friendly?

Jamstack sites are made by stitching together several building blocks, including a headless CMS, SSG, and additional tools for hosting, versioning, etc. Traditionally, this has been impossible for non-developers and a challenge for those with coding experience. As a result, Jamstack sites were inaccessible to the vast majority of people who needed a website. Stackbit provides a user-friendly interface that allows beginners to create and manage a Jamstack site while offering developers unprecedented freedom, making it a great option for everybody.

Stackbit also offers features that Magento does not, including previews of site edits before they go live and the ability to share unpublished pages with other team members. By leveraging third-party tools like Stripe or [Snipcart](https://snipcart.com/blog/manage-jamstack-websites-stackbit), you can add [ecommerce functionality to your Stackbit site](https://www.stackbit.com/blog/ecommerce-jamstack/). Stackbit also offers powerful [SEO tools](https://www.stackbit.com/blog/seo-tools/) out of the box, while you need to navigate extensions and plugins to get similar tools out of Magento. If you’re still on the fence, here are a few more benefits:

- Developer tools
- Collaboration tools
- Front-end modular editing
- Excellent mobile responsiveness
- And so much more

## The Final Word: Stackbit versus Magento

Magento offers powerful tools for e-commerce, but it can be difficult and costly to utilize them to their full potential. Jamstack sites are just as capable as Magento sites, and Stackbit makes them much easier to use. Try Stackbit today and experience for yourself how we are making the web, better.
