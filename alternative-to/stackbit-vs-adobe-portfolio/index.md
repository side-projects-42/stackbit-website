# Why Jamstack Sites Managed by Stackbit: Are More Flexible Alternatives to Adobe Portfolio

Stackbit vs. Adobe Portfolio: Stackbit is a powerful Adobe Portfolio alternative where you own your content and easily edit it. Here’s how Stackbit and Adobe Portfolio compare to one another.

If you're looking for a great portfolio site to help you showcase your artistic talents, Adobe Portfolio is probably one of the first services you'll encounter. Adobe Portfolio offers an easy to use page builder to help you create a portfolio site without writing any code, removing a potentially significant barrier to entry. Nearly 100,000 artists are showing off on Adobe Portfolio, and you might be wondering if you should join them.

Adobe Portfolio is a good service, but it doesn't offer as much creative freedom as you might expect from a product aimed at creatives. It's also a bundle, which means you have to pay for services that you may not actually need. Adobe Portfolio is completely incapable of making other types of sites as well, meaning that you can't add a blog or e-commerce capabilities to your site. If you want a great looking site that's easy to build and meets all of your needs, we strongly recommend a Jamstack site managed by Stackbit instead.

## What is the Stackbit platform exactly?

Stackbit is the world's first complete platform for the Jamstack, attaching a user-friendly interface to some of the web's most powerful development tools. If you don't have any programming experience, Stackbit Site Builder makes it easy to select a theme and customize it to your needs. When you're done, you can make any necessary changes on Stackbit Studio: a WYSIWYG editing tool that allows you to edit your site without touching any code. It's just as easy as Adobe Portfolio and more powerful to boot.

If you are a web developer (or are willing to hire one), Stackbit gives you much more creative freedom than Adobe Portfolio. If you already have a site, you can use Stackbit to [import it to the Jamstack ecosystem](https://app.stackbit.com/import). Alternatively, you can create a custom theme to help your site stand out in a crowd. You can also use your favorite headless CMS (content management system), SSG (static site generator), and development tools in Stackbit. Please continue reading to learn more about what Stackbit and the Jamstack can do.

## What makes a Jamstack site such a powerful alternative to Adobe Portfolio?

Adobe Portfolio's page builder asks you to pick a theme to begin your site, but your selection also effectively ends the creation process. You can upload your images and create media galleries, but the only real customization options available are changing your site's font and background color. This restriction is in place to prevent novices from inadvertently compromising their site's responsiveness, but it also limits your control over what the final product looks like. Worse, your site will have the same format as everybody else's. Jamstack sites provide developers with complete creative freedom, allowing for the creation of sites that pop in a sea of standard Adobe Portfolio themes.

Likewise, you might not want to limit yourself to just a portfolio site. Blogging may not be at the forefront of your mind as an artist, but doing so can help you communicate your vision behind a piece or articulate your creative process. These little details could be the difference between selling a piece and losing a prospective sale. Speaking of sales, Adobe Portfolio doesn't allow you to sell your work directly. You could link to another site and hope you don't lose your lead at some point during the extended sales funnel, but wouldn't it be easier to have one site that could do it all? Jamstack sites can offer that.

You also need to pay at least $9.99 per month to use Adobe Portfolio. That price includes additional services such as Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom, which are nice to have but may not be necessary for your needs. You will also see a popup advertising Creative Cloud every time you access your site, a bigger bundle that includes services such as Adobe InDesign and Illustrator for $52.99 a month. Both options require one-year contracts, locking you in even if your needs change.

## How can Stackbit make Jamstack sites more user-friendly?

Jamstack sites are created by combining building blocks such as a headless CMS and SSG into a cohesive whole. This structure allows users to load your entire site at once, making it faster. It also leaves hackers with relatively few points of entry. Unfortunately, it is very time-consuming for developers to manually splice all of the blocks together, making Jamstack sites less accessible. Stackbit fixes this by automating site creation and maintenance, putting a user-friendly interface that anybody can use on otherwise intimidating Jamstack sites.

If you're an artist on a budget, Stackbit Site Builder and Stackbit Studio are the only tools you need to create and maintain a great online portfolio without professional assistance. If you're [a developer at an agency](https://www.stackbit.com/agencies) specializing in artistic clients, you can leave day-to-day content management to them while designing slick features outside of Stackbit Studio to help them stand out. Adobe Portfolio simply doesn't offer comparable flexibility.

Stackbit includes a myriad of other features to help you manage your site as well. Here are a few of our favorites:

- Ability to edit your site’s code
- [SEO toolbox](https://www.stackbit.com/blog/seo-tools/) to easily add metadata, alt tags, and define social-media sharing elements on any webpage.Live previews of all edits

- Front-end modular editing

## Conclusion: Stackbit or Adobe Portfolio?

Adobe Portfolio works if you want a basic portfolio site, but you'll need to look at other services if you want something more. Jamstack sites managed by Stackbit combine powerful features, creative flexibility, and ease of use in one stunning package ideally suited for your needs. Try it today and experience what it means to make the web, better.
