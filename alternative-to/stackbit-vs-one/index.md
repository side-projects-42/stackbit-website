Stackbit: A Powerful Alternative to One.com Website Builder
===========================================================

Stackbit vs. One.com: Stackbit is a powerful One.com alternative where you own your content and easily edit it. Here’s how Stackbit and One.com compare to one another.

One.com's Website Builder offers an intuitive drag-and-drop interface and doesn't require any programming expertise, making it a popular choice for first-time website owners. It also has a reputation as an affordable option, making One.com a reasonable choice to create a site cheaply. Roughly 225,000 active sites use One.com's page builder.

That said, the old adage “you get what you pay for” is true in this case. There is a cap on how many pages a One.com site can have unless you pay extra. You are also limited to bland blog post designs, payment processing with high fees, and a poor selection of widgets to expand functionality. One.com allows developers who know how to code to create their own widgets, but why not just choose a more powerful page-builder in that case? Jamstack sites are powerful alternatives to One.com that can provide the functionality you're looking for. Stackbit also makes them just as easy to create and maintain.

What is Stackbit and who should use it?
---------------------------------------

Stackbit is the world's first complete platform for the Jamstack, making some of the web's most powerful tools more accessible than they have ever been before. If you're interested in One.com Website Builder because you've heard it's easy to use, Stackbit Site Builder offers the same core mechanism of choosing a theme and instantly creating a site.. Stackbit Studio also lets you make changes to your site without touching its underlying code, so you don't have to worry about accidentally pulling your site offline.

Unlike One.com Website Builder, Stackbit is a powerful tool for developers as well. Stackbit is brand-agnostic, allowing developers to use their preferred headless content management system (or CMS) and SSG (static site generator) to realize their vision. You can also [import an existing site](https://app.stackbit.com/import) or create a custom theme from scratch. You can even write your own code to expand your site's functionality without the constraints One.com forces on you. Please continue reading to find out more about the power of Jamstack sites managed by Stackbit.

Why are Jamstack sites better than their One.com counterparts?
--------------------------------------------------------------

The biggest limitation of One.com sites is the hard cap of five web pages. That might sound like a lot, but you'll quickly discover that it isn't. There's also no way to integrate a blog on your site. Instead, it has to be relegated to a subdomain. One.com sites generally look good on all devices, but blog posts look dated and you only have so many templates to choose from. Jamstack sites don't have any of these limitations. Your site can have as many pages as you need to reach for your goals, including an integrated blog and countless design options.

One.com's status as an affordable option is also questionable if you look beneath the hood. Their advertised prices only apply to your first month, after which you'll automatically renew at their current rates. Their Beginner plan costs $4.99 per month and offers 50 GB of storage and a stated speed of one out of five. The Explorer plan gives you 100 GB storage and a speed of two for $7.99 per month. The Enthusiast plan gives you up to five sites and 200 GB for $10.99 each month, but your speed is only a three. The Expert plan costs $14.99 per month and includes up to seven sites and 500 GB and a speed of four. Finally, you have to sign up for 10 websites with a Guru plan if you want One.com's top speed. 

You are also charged separately for basic e-commerce capabilities and “premium” page-builder features such as additional templates and HD image support. One.com doesn’t include domain names or one-time setup fees in its advertised prices either.

How does Stackbit make Jamstack sites more accessible?
------------------------------------------------------

Jamstack sites are created by melding several building blocks into a single entity, including your headless CMS, SSG, and additional tools for hosting and versioning. This structure is good because it allows visitors to load your entire site at once instead of piecemeal, leading to speeds a lot better than one out of five. It also leaves hackers with fewer points of entry, helping potential customers feel more comfortable sharing payment information with you. Its biggest downside is that it can be tough for developers to manually put together, a problem that Stackbit solves.

[Stackbit Studio](https://www.stackbit.com/blog/announcing-stackbit-studio/) is usable by everyone, allowing [business owners](https://www.stackbit.com/businesses) to control their own Jamstack sites while developers can leave content management to other people. Developers can also create slick features that most people could not, allowing you to make your site stand out or keep clients around for add ons if you’re an [agency](https://www.stackbit.com/agencies). Stackbit is not a walled garden, and you can choose any services you like. Unfortunately, One.com Website Builder's e-commerce plan forces you to use Stripe for your credit card processing, adding more fees to your monthly bill.

Stackbit supports a variety of other powerful features as well, including the following:

-   [SEO toolbox](https://www.stackbit.com/blog/seo-tools/) to easily add metadata, alt tags, and define social-media sharing elements on any webpage.
-   Front-end modular editing
-   Collaborative tools
-   Live previews of site edits
-   Built-in mobile responsiveness
-   Ability to share unpublished pages
-   Developer tools

The Verdict: Stackbit or One.com Website Builder?
-------------------------------------------------

One.com Website Builder is easy to use to the point of compromising functionality. It's also considerably less affordable when you factor in how quickly monthly fees can add up. Instead, why not choose a Jamstack site managed by Stackbit that's just as easy to use with much more horsepower? We are ready to help you make the web, better.
