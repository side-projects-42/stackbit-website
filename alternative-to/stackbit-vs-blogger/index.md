# Stackbit: The Best Alternative to Blogger

Stackbit vs. Blogger: Stackbit is a powerful Blogger alternative where you own your content and easily edit it. Hereâ€™s how Stackbit and Blogger compare to one another.

If you're interested in starting your own blog, you're probably familiar with Google's free Blogger page-builder. It's one of the easier ways to create a website, and you can have your first post online in less than an hour. It also offers integration with a variety of other Google services, including Google Adsense to monetize your blog and Google Analytics to help you analyze traffic. More than 600,000 people have used Blogger to create an online presence, so you know it works.

Unfortunately, Blogger sites are as bare-bones as it gets. You can publish blog posts, moderate comments, and that's it. Google could also decide to discontinue the service at any time, meaning that the site you worked so hard to create will simply vanish. You also have to pay for a template that can stand up to other page-builders visually. If you're ready to graduate from Blogger, the Stackbit offers a robust suite of tools that you can use to make an excellent website for a variety of needs. We'd be the first to admit that working with the Jamstack hasn't always been intuitive, but our Stackbit platform is changing that.

## What is Stackbit?

Stackbit is the first complete platform for the Jamstack. If you try it, we're confident that you won't want to create a website any other way. There are two large groups of people who can benefit from Stackbit: bloggers and entrepreneurs who want to manage their own websites, and web developers looking for a platform that won't stifle their creativity.

If you don't have any web development experience, the Stackbit Site Builder includes a myriad of templates to give you a jump start creating your own site. You can also edit your work with the WYSIWYG [Stackbit Studio](https://www.stackbit.com/blog/announcing-stackbit-studio/) so you won't need professional assistance every time you update something.

Meanwhile, professional web developers can import their favorite tools to the Jamstack ecosystem through Stackbit Site Builder. The Stackbit Studio is also intuitive enough to be trusted to other people, allowing a company's development team to concentrate exclusively on technical assignments. Please continue reading to learn more about the power of Stackbit and the Jamstack relative to Blogger.

## What are some of the advantages that make Jamstack sites a good Blogger alternative?

Blogger makes it easy to create your own website, but it's difficult to customize your site's template to your needs. In contrast, with Stackbitot you can choose a theme to get you started without compromising the freedom to design your site your way. You also have an extensive library of themes to choose from in the Jamstack ecosystem, and you can always import your own custom theme if you'd like.

Both Blogger and Stackbit let you launch a site for free, but free Blogger sites have to use a blogspot.com domain name that lets readers know they're reading a free site. It can be difficult to get support for Blogger as well.

Perhaps most importantly, Google makes it very difficult to move your site from Blogger to another service. Your site's source code is owned by Google, and its content may be claimed too. Some users have even reported that their site took an SEO hit on Google after moving to another service. In contrast, a Jamstack website with Stackbit allows you to edit your site's source code to get the functionality you're looking for. You always own your site's code, and it's easy to move it if you decide you don't want to use the Jamstack anymore.

## How does Stackbit make Jamstack sites more user-friendly?

Jamstack sites are simple in theory. Each page is a combination of a headless CMS (or content management system) that stores your site, a static site generator (or SSG) that takes content from your CMS and renders it in an appropriate format quickly, and several additional tools for hosting, versioning, etc. Unfortunately, it can be time-consuming and difficult for developers to combine these distinct elements into a cohesive whole without Stackbit.

We created Stackbit to remove the hassles associated with the Jamstack. Developers can bring their favorite CMS and SSG into the Jamstack infrastructure through the Stackbit Site Builder, so you can keep working with the tools you're comfortable with. The Stackbit Studio is also designed for individuals who don't know how to code, allowing freelancers and business owners to manage their site without learning React. If you're a marketing professional concerned about losing billable hours, don't worry. You can still implement additional features on your Jamstack sites such as sliders that clients would struggle to achieve on their own.

Stackbit is also brand-agnostic, meaning that we don't care what products you use to develop your site or add functionality. As you might expect, Blogger integrates with Google products seamlessly, but nothing else is compatible. Both services allow users to preview edits, but Stackbit also provides collaborative tools that Blogger sites struggle to match. If you're interested in e-commerce, Stackbit offers powerful marketing tools while Blogger can't help you at all.

Here are a few of the other advantages Stackbit can offer:

- Built-in mobile responsiveness
- [SEO toolbox](https://www.stackbit.com/blog/seo-tools/) to easily add metadata, alt tags, and define social-media sharing elements on any webpage.
- Front-end modular editing
- Ability to share unpublished page
- And much, much more

## Final Verdict

If you're a hobbyist, Blogger is an easy-to-use free option to get you online. If you're creating a site as part of your business or on behalf of a client, the Jamstack and Stackbit provide much more powerful features. Don't take our word for it though. Try it for yourself and discover how you can make the web, better.
