# Stackbit and the Jamstack: The Best Alternative to Beaver Builder

Stackbit vs. Beaver: Stackbit is a powerful Beaver alternative where you own your content and easily edit it. Here’s how Stackbit and Beaver compare to one another.

Beaver Builder is a plugin for WordPress marketed as a complete design system including a drag-and-drop page builder and a framework theme. It makes WordPress site creation more intuitive, allowing individuals with no coding experience to effectively manage their websites. It is also compatible with the majority of third-party WordPress add-ons, giving developers more creative freedom than a lot of other builders. Nearly 200,000 active websites were created with Beaver Builder.

That said, Beaver Builder has more than its fair share of flaws. It is one of the priciest page builder plugins available. You also need third-party extensions for certain features, many of which cost money. Users even complain of slow loading times, especially when trying to edit their site. If you want to create and manage websites without these restrictions, Stackbit makes Jamstack sites more accessible than ever before.

## What is the Stackbit platform?

Stackbit is a complete platform for the Jamstack, giving nearly anyone unrestricted access to some of the web's most powerful development tools. If you don't have any HTML skills, Stackbit Site Builder is a front-end page builder that lets you see what you're changing in real-time. You can [pick a theme](http://jamstackthemes.dev/?utm_source=stackbit.com&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=alternative-to-beaver) to get started and customize it to your liking, ensuring that you don't look the same as your competitors. You can also update your site using Stackbit Studio, a WYSIWYG editing tool that allows you to edit your site without touching code.

Unlike many page builders targeted at novices, Stackbit also offers powerful functionality for developers. You can [import an existing site](https://app.stackbit.com/import) or create a custom theme to get started, ensuring that you don't feel restricted by a premade theme. You can also use your preferred development tools, a flexibility that Beaver Builder doesn't offer. Please continue reading to learn more about Stackbit, the Jamstack, and how you can use them to make the web, better.

## Why should I select a Jamstack site as a Beaver Builder alternative?

Before we focus on Beaver Builder itself, it’s important to note that you're really getting a WordPress site when you use it. We’ve previously reviewed Stackbit as a WordPress alternative, where we discussed the security risks, maintenance hassles, true costs, dated tech stack, and other inconveniences of having a WordPress site.

When it comes to Beaver Builder, you’re likely adding price in exchange for a bit more convenience, but the security risks and other drawbacks of WordPress remain. There is a free “Lite” version available, but it lacks extremely basic features such as buttons. If you want anything for your visitors to click on, you'll need to pay at least $99 per year for a Standard license. If you want the Beaver Builder theme that plays a prominent role in the plugin's marketing, you'll have to upgrade to a Pro license for $199 a year. If you're looking for complete design flexibility and the ability to remove Beaver Builder branding on the sites you create, you need to spend $399 per year for the Agency package. Beaver Builder also offers extensions such as Beaver Themer that allow users to edit headers, footers, and other site elements for an additional $200 per year. Everything renews automatically as well, though you get a 40 percent discount in year two.

Beaver Builder also lacks features even if you buy all of the extensions. For example, you'll need third-party addons to create custom forms. Some of these addons can make Beaver Builder or WordPress slow and unresponsive, hurting your site's performance. You may also have to pay for them, further increasing what Beaver Builder costs. Worst of all, third-party add-ons can be easy targets for hackers looking to get into your site. In contrast, Jamstack sites are stored as single entities in a headless CMS (or content management system) and rendered by your SSG (or static site generator), leading to both faster load times and fewer points of entry for hackers.

## How does Stackbit make Jamstack sites easier to manage?

Jamstack sites are created by manually piecing several components together, including a headless CMS, SSG, and tools for hosting, versioning, and more. This process can be difficult for even professional web developers, putting Jamstack sites out of reach for average people. Stackbit handles the technical side and gives users an intuitive interface for creating and managing Jamstack sites. If you want to manage your [business's site](https://www.stackbit.com/businesses) without relying on outside help or hiring a developer, Stackbit is for you. If you're a developer who's tired of hearing from clients who inadvertently broke their site trying to edit it, Stackbit Studio protects your code and makes content updates simple thanks to an easy WYSIWYG interface.

Stackbit themes are also less rigid than their WordPress equivalents. If your WordPress theme doesn't support full-width pages, you won't be able to add them even though Beaver Builder supports that functionality. Stackbit themes are more like starters: a valuable resource for beginners who need help creating a modern website, but not something that's ever going to get in the way.

Stackbit offers a variety of other great features as well, including the following:

- [SEO toolbox](https://www.stackbit.com/blog/seo-tools/) to easily add metadata, alt tags, and define social-media sharing elements on any webpage.
- Front-end modular editing
- Live previews of all changes
- Collaboration tools
- Development tools
- Ability to share unpublished pages
- Built-in mobile responsiveness

## Conclusion: Stackbit or Beaver Builder?

Beaver Builder was once the standard all page-builders were judged by, but it has been surpassed by several competing options. Stackbit and the Jamstack are one of the best because they combine ease of use with all of the power you need your website to have. Try it once and you'll never want to build any other way.
