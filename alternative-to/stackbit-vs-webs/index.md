Why Jamstack Sites Managed by Stackbit Are Superior to Webs
===========================================================

Stackbit vs. Webs: Stackbit is a powerful Webs alternative where you own your content and easily edit it. Here’s how Stackbit and Webs compare to one another.

Webs offered one of the most established page-builders available, tracing its history back to 2001. The service allowed novices to create sites by choosing one of several templates and editing it to their needs. However, Webs was acquired by Vistaprint and is no longer building new sites. Roughly 125,000 active websites were created on the Webs page-builder, but prospective customers are now directed to Vistaprint’s website builder instead.

Unfortunately, Webs sites are showing their age. Their templates weren't top-notch, and loading times can be on the longer side. You also don't get some of the functionality you might expect, such as the freedom to select your preferred payment processor on e-commerce sites. If you're looking for an alternative to Vistaprint website builder or Webs that's easy to create and manage, a Jamstack site managed by Stackbit is the ideal choice. Try it once and you won't want to build any other way.

What is the Stackbit platform and who is it intended for?
---------------------------------------------------------

Stackbit is a user-friendly interface for the creation and maintenance of Jamstack sites. If you've never created a website before, Stackbit Site Builder makes it easy to select a theme and customize it to your needs without any programming experience. If you want to make changes, Stackbit Studio is a WYSIWYG editing tool that makes it simple. Stackbit provides the convenience of Webs without the corresponding limitations.

Web developers can also get a lot out of Stackbit. You can [import a site](https://app.stackbit.com/import) or design a custom theme on Stackbit Site Builder, giving you a head start on realizing your vision. You can also create slick features in your source code, allowing you to make sites stand out while simultaneously trusting day-to-day content management to your clients or less experienced employees. Keep reading to learn more about all of the advantages Stackbit and the Jamstack can offer.

Why are Jamstack sites a great alternative to Webs?
---------------------------------------------------

Webs sites were easy to create, but this came at the expense of flexibility. Your template won't let you place design elements wherever you want, preventing beginners from cluttering their page. However, it also prevents more experienced users from creating what they want to. Webs doesn't support third-party add-ons either, limiting what your site could do. In contrast, Stackbit is not a walled garden. Both Stackbit Site Builder and [Stackbit Studio](https://www.stackbit.com/blog/announcing-stackbit-studio/) offer complete freedom to create anything you can think of, and developers can add functionality at the CMS level.

The costs associated with competitors can also add up quickly. For example, Vistaprint Website Builder offers three packages to consider. Their Get Personal plan costs $3.75 per month and includes only basic features such as a form builder and media gallery. You are also forced into using a Vistaprint subdomain, making your site look less professional than it could. Upgrading to the Get Professional plan adds SEO tools and includes a custom domain, but you also have to pay $13.50 a month. Finally, Vistaprint’s Get Paid plan unlocks basic e-commerce functionality for $18.75 per month. 

Webs sites lack an export function, forcing you to start all over again as soon as you want a new site. Since you no longer have the option of creating Webs sites, why not upgrade to a Jamstack site managed by Stackbit that will be able to grow with you? You always own your Jamstack site’s underlying code, so you won’t find yourself in a similar situation again. 

How does Stackbit make Jamstack sites easier to maintain?
---------------------------------------------------------

Jamstack sites are created by manually combining a headless content management system (or CMS), static site generator (SSG), and several additional tools. This structure improves site performance because your site is stored and rendered as a cohesive whole, making it load much more quickly than Webs sites. It also leaves hackers with fewer vulnerabilities to exploit. However, it's time consuming and potentially challenging for developers to manually put the pieces together.

Stackbit automates that process so that virtually anyone can create a professional-looking site on the Jamstack. If you [own a business](https://www.stackbit.com/businesses), Stackbit Site Builder and Stackbit Studio allow you to create and manage your company's site without relying on paid outside help. Likewise, web developers can allow their clients to manage their sites without worrying that they will accidentally take it offline. As an added bonus for [agencies](https://www.stackbit.com/agencies), clients will still need to come to you for development work when it’s time to add features.

Stackbit even offers handy features to make editing your site a breeze. For example, you can share unpublished pages with your team to foster a more collaborative creative environment. You can also view previews of all site changes before they go live. Here are a few more of our favorite Stackbit features:

-   [SEO toolbox](https://www.stackbit.com/blog/seo-tools/) to easily add metadata, alt tags, and define social-media sharing elements on any webpage.
-   Front-end modular editing
-   Built-in mobile responsiveness
-   Developer tools
-   Collaboration tools
-   And more

Webs could not match any of these features, perhaps explaining why the brand name is no longer used as a page builder.

Final Word: Stackbit vs. Webs
-----------------------------

Webs was one of the first WYSIWYG page builders, but that doesn't mean it was the best. If you don’t want to move on to Vistaprint website builder, Jamstack sites managed by Stackbit are a great Vistaprint alternative, offering faster load times, better security, and improved functionality without compromising on ease of use. If you need a sleek new website, give it a shot today and do your part to make the web, better.
