# Jamstack eCommerce Sites: A Flexible, Secure Alternative to WooCommerce

Stackbit vs. WooCommerce: Stackbit is a powerful WooCommerce alternative where you own your content and easily edit it. Here’s how Stackbit and WooCommerce compare to one another.

WooCommerce is an open-source plugin that adds ecommerce functionality to sites built with the WordPress CMS, adding on the ability to manage product categories, products, pricing, inventory, orders, and customers within WordPress’s familiar environment. WordPress’s ubiquity contributes to WooCommerce’s popularity, and it’s used by almost 4 million sites. WooCommerce offers thousands of free and fee-based third-party plugins, extensions, and themes that enhance a WooCommerce site’s functionality.

However, WooCommerce’s relationship with WordPress also means it carries [many of the same disadvantages](https://www.stackbit.com/alternative-to/stackbit-vs-wordpress). Although WooCommerce is currently the most popular ecommerce platform, its star is fading. Lately, more and more freelance and agency-based developers are turning to the Jamstack.

## What is Stackbit?

Jamstack sites are secure, speedy, and economical, but it can be hard for those with no web development experience to navigate. Jamstack sites consist of three main components: a headless content management system (CMS), a static site generator (SSG), and deployment tools. Stackbit’s Site Builder is a platform that connects your tools of choice, providing you with the infrastructure to support your Jamstack sites in one place.

While developers love the flexibility of using their preferred tools, someone with less experience may be overwhelmed with, for example, diving into the code to update a store’s front page to promote a sale. If you intend to hand over the editing duties to a client, it’s important to provide them with a simple way to update the site’s main pages. [Stackbit Studio](https://www.stackbit.com/blog/announcing-stackbit-studio/) adds usability to the mix, giving clients and stakeholders a drag-and-drop front-end interface that makes Jamstack sites as easy to use as those created with WooCommerce.

## WooCommerce vs. Jamstack

As a WordPress plugin, WooCommerce seems like an easy choice when it comes to opening up an ecommerce site. It’s free to use for the basic setup, and it’s a very attractive option for developers. But when it comes to ecommerce, there are some non-negotiable qualities that a website’s simply gotta have, and the Stackbit platform helps you create a Jamstack website that gives you the edge on all of them:

#### Security

WooCommerce: Runs the application live to load pages, giving hackers the chance to interfere with your database.

Jamstack: Static sites are generated using an SSG and are distributed to CDNs, eliminating the most popular hack points.

#### Speed 

WooCommerce: Plugins that enhance your WooCommerce site’s functionality can slow your site’s performance, as can its monolithic nature.

Jamstack: Static Jamstack sites are nimble because they’re supported by modern web architecture.

There’s more than meets the eye when it comes to this list, though. Let’s break down the biggest risk of trusting your business’s ecommerce to a WooCommerce site.

## How vulnerable is WooCommerce?

WooCommerce is a worthwhile target for hackers, and in fact, over 70% of sites run by WordPress have been hacked. While its competitors often employ white hat hackers to proactively uncover holes in the system, WordPress and WooCommerce rely on frequent security updates. However, these frequent updates are one of the top reasons why WooCommerce sites are so vulnerable.

Because so many of WooCommerce’s best functions are provided through third-party plugins, you must rely on their developers to keep up with WooCommerce and WordPress’s frequent security updates. Any third-party plugins that aren’t updated promptly along with these updates can leave your site vulnerable, and hackers are poised to exploit these chances.

WooCommerce sites are also served by running the application live to load pages upon user request. There are a variety of different points at which a hacker might interfere, and the many different WooCommerce plugins you need to run a store properly can affect your site’s speed and performance. Jamstack sites are pre-rendered and waiting to serve at CDNs around the world, minimizing the chances of meddling.

## What’s the cost of WooCommerce?

If your WooCommerce site is hacked, the cost will go far beyond immediate monetary loss. While other sites might lose data, losing control of sensitive ecommerce information like your customers’ addresses, personal details, payment methods, and more can decimate your reputation. Putting your trust in third-party WooCommerce plugin developers is like handing over the keys to your store to a total stranger. And by the way, this stranger is going to charge you for the privilege too.

WooCommerce’s basic plan is free, but it doesn’t offer you or your clients a lot of options. To create a WooCommerce site with great functionality, you’re going to need some plugins for your plugin. For example, if you’re a t-shirt designer, allowing customers to choose a size, color, logo, or any other customization is vital. To get the functionality you want, you’ll need to find a plugin that suits your needs. The problem is, these plugins are going to cost you dearly.

If you wish to offer subscription services, appointment booking, or advanced shipping methods, you’ll need to pay up. And if you want to keep your site secure, you need to pay for the plugins’ latest updates _annually_. Each of these plugins can run up to $300 a year. Along with hosting, design, and payment processing fees, these can really add up for a small business. An average website costs between $1,000-3,000, and depending on your annual fees, you might pay over half that price each year.
