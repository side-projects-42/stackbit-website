Is Stackbit Right for Me?
-------------------------

If you build websites, we certainly think so! Weâ€™ve put together some materials to help our core audiences get the most out of Stackbit and the Jamstack.

-   ### For Agencies & Freelancers

    If you create websites for a living, you know how challenging it can be to hand off a site and trust that your client can rely on it. Stackbit takes that a step further â€” your clients will love updating their site with our inline editor and collaborating with their internal stakeholders.

-   ### For Marketers

    Deploy marketing sites, internal facing pages, single page apps, and more on the Jamstack while giving your stakeholders the best possible editing, feature testing and mobile experience. Marketers can now yield the power of the Jamstack without learning how to code.

-   ### For Any Developer

    If you've spent some time working with the Jamstack, you know how frustrating it can be to glue everything together. Maybe you've wondered if advanced features like live previews and A/B testing are even possible. Choose one of our starter themes or import your own, to see how it all fits together with Stackbit.
