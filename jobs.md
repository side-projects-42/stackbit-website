Working at Stackbit
-------------------

##### We are a lean team of explorers, builders, scientists and just plain curious folks who live and breathe the Jamstack. We decided to tackle the massive challenge of orchestrating an ever-growing set of tools that need to play nicely together, and we keep this in mind with every project we decide to take on. 

  
At Stackbit, you will have the prerogative to make things happen, along with empowerment to determine what these "things" are. You will be part of a flat, fully distributed organization, with an uncanny entrepreneurial spirit and relentless motivation to move the needle where it counts.  

We help each other, uplift each other, and rely on each other's feedback and expertise to inform our choices and help us make the web, better.

What We Do
----------

Stackbit is the first open, complete platform for the Jamstack — it's the easiest way to get started with the best tools for the modern web. Our website production platform, based on next-gen Jamstack technology, rethinks how we build, edit and even host websites. We are on a mission to make this modern architecture available and easily usable for everyone — developers, marketers, content creators and designers.
